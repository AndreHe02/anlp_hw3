Use the information given to set up an equation to solve for the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.\n3. Solve the equation to find the initial number of vacuum cleaners.\n\nAnswer:\nLet's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as x.\nShe sold x/3 at the green house, then 2 more at the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. This can be represented as x/3 + 2 + (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = 5.\nSolving the equation, we get x = 12.\nTherefore, the answer is Melanie started with 12 vacuum cleaners.",
            "Strategy:\nLet x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. We know that she sold a third at the green house, 2 more at the red house, half of what was left at the orange house, and has 5 left. We can set up an equation based on this information to solve for x.\n\nAnswer:\nLet x be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.\n1/3x (green house) + 2 (red house) + 1/2(2/3x - 2) (orange house) + 5 = x\n1/3x + 2 + 1/3x - 2 + 5 = x\n2/3x + 5 = x\n5 = 1/3x\nx = 5 * 3\nx = 15\n\nTherefore, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners, the answer is 15."

The collar takes a tenth of that, so it takes 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette takes twice as many as the collar, so it takes 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

Then, we can find the difference between these two values to determine how much electric energy Mel will save in 30 days.\n\nAnswer:\nMel uses 900 watts for 8 hours a day, so he consumes 900 watts x 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours per day.\n\nIf he reduces the usage by 5 hours a day, he will only be using the AC for 3 hours a day, consuming 900 watts x 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day.\n\nThe difference between the two scenarios is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh saved per day.\n\nIn 30 days, Mel will save 4.5 kWh/day x 30 days = 135 kWh.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 135.",

Considering he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he will have 200 + 100 - 180 = 120 shoes on Sunday. Therefore, the answer is 120.",
            "Strategy:\nCalculate the total number of shoes Frank gains throughout the week, then subtract the number of shoes he gets rid of on Saturday.\n\nAnswer:\nFrank gains a total of 5 + 15 + 30 = 50 new pairs of shoes throughout the week, which is a total of 50 x 2 = 100 shoes. If he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, he will have (200 + 100) - 180 = 120 shoes on Sunday.\nTherefore, the answer is 120.",

Since the research took 10 times longer than initially planned, it took a total of 50 months (5 initial months + 45 additional months).

From 5 pm to 10 am the next morning is a total of 17 hours. So Cameron would need to pay for 5 additional hours at 70 pesos each, which is 350 pesos. Thus, the total cost of staying for 12 hours plus the additional hours would be 1350 pesos. \n\nIf Cameron were to stay for 24 hours, he would pay 1600 pesos. Therefore, by choosing to add on 70 pesos for every additional hour after the 12-hour mark, Cameron would save 250 pesos. \n\nSo, the answer is 250.",

Cameron will stay an additional 6 hours (from 10 pm to 4 am), so he will need to pay 70 pesos per hour for these 6 hours, which amounts to 420 pesos.

Cameron arrives at 5 pm and wants to leave at 10 am the next morning, which is a total of 17 hours (12 hours + 5 additional hours). The cost of the additional 5 hours is 70 pesos x 5 hours = 350 pesos. The total cost of staying for 17 hours is 1000 pesos + 350 pesos = 1350 pesos.

Add up the letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.\n\nAnswer:\nThe post office delivered 425 letters on Monday. One-fifth of 425 is 85, so they delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters on Tuesday. On Wednesday, they delivered (102 x 2) + 5 = 209 letters. Therefore, the post office delivered 425 + 102 + 209 = 736 letters Monday - Wednesday. So, the answer is 736.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Calculate one-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday, then add 17 to find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday.\n2. Multiply the number of letters delivered on Tuesday by 2, then add 5 to find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday.\n3. Add up the number of letters delivered on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday to find the total.\n\nAnswer:\nThe post office delivered 85 letters on Tuesday and 100 letters on Wednesday. \nTherefore, the post office delivered a total of 425 + 85 + 100 = 610 letters Monday - Wednesday. \nSo, the answer is 610.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, calculate how many letters were delivered on Tuesday by finding one-fifth of Monday's total plus 17. Then, calculate how many letters were delivered on Wednesday by finding twice Tuesday's total plus 5. Finally, add up the total number of letters delivered Monday to Wednesday.\n\nAnswer:\nThe post office delivered 85 letters on Tuesday and 190 letters on Wednesday. Therefore, the total number of letters delivered Monday to Wednesday is 425 + 85 + 190 = 700. So, the answer is 700."

We can now set up an equation to solve for x.\n\nAnswer:\nWe know that x + x + x + (12 - 3x) = 12, as there are a total of 12 pints of paint used in the mural. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n3x + 12 - 3x = 12\n12 = 12\n\nThis equation holds true regardless of the value of x, which means that there is an infinite number of solutions to this problem.

Then, we can calculate half of this amount to determine how many pints of yellow paint were used. Finally, we can subtract the combined amount of white and purple paint from the total amount of paint used to find out how many pints of red paint were used.\n\nAnswer:\nDividing 12 pints by 4, we get 3 pints per color. Half of 3 pints is 1.5 pints, so 1.5 pints of yellow paint were used. White and purple paint together make up 3 pints, so the remaining paint must be red: 12 pints - 3 pints (white + purple) - 1.5 pints (yellow) = 7.5 pints.

Then, we can determine how much yellow paint was used. Finally, we can find out how many pints of red paint were used based on the information given.\n\nAnswer:\nIf 12 pints of paint were used in total, then each of the red, white, and purple colors must have used 12 / 4 = 3 pints of paint each.

Since half of the mural is yellow, this means that there are 3 parts of yellow paint. Therefore, the red, white, purple, and yellow paints are in a ratio of 3:3:3:6. \nSince there are 12 pints of paint in all, each part represents 12/15 = 4 pints.

Finally, add up the remaining apples to determine how many Newton brought home.\n\nAnswer:\nAfter the first two apples fell, Newton put one in his pocket and threw one, resulting in 5 more apples falling out. He put 4 in his pocket and threw 1 more, which caused 6 apples to fall out. In total, 13 apples fell out of the tree.

After throwing one apple back into the tree, there are 5 more apples that fall, making a total of 7 apples. Newton puts all but one of these apples in his pocket, so he has 2 + 1 + 5 - 1 = 7 apples. When Newton throws the remaining apple at the tree, 6 more apples fall. After picking up all the apples, Newton has 7 + 6 = 13 apples.\n\nTherefore, the answer is Newton brought home 13 apples.",

He put 1 in his pocket, leaving 1 to throw at the tree. This resulted in 5 more apples falling out of the tree, so he picked up a total of 6 apples. After putting all but 1 in his pocket and throwing the remaining apple at the tree, 6 more apples fell out. Newton then picked up all of the 6 apples, bringing the total apples picked up to 7.
