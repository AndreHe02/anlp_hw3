Jean is two years older than Mark: J = M + 2\n2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half Jan's age: M - 2 = 5 + 0.5*(30-2)\n\nSolving the above equations:\nFrom equation 2: M - 2 = 5 + 0.5*(28) \nM - 2 = 5 + 14\nM = 21\n\nUsing M = 21 in equation 1: J = 21 + 2\nJ = 23\n\nTherefore, Jean is 23 years old.\nthe answer is 23",

            "Strategy:\nTo find the amount of energy saved by Mel in 30 days, we will first calculate the energy consumed by the air conditioner in one day using 900 watts per hour. Then we will multiply this value by the number of hours Mel has reduced the usage per day. Finally, we will convert the total energy saved from watts to kilowatts.\n\nAnswer:\nMel's air conditioner consumes 900 watts per hour, so in one day it consumes 900 watts/hour x 8 hours = 7200 watts/day.\nIf Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the new consumption in one day will be 900 watts/hour x 3 hours = 2700 watts/day.\nOver 30 days, the amount of energy saved will be 4500 watts/day x 30 days = 135,000 watts.\nConverting this amount to kilowatts, we get 135,000 watts / 1000 = 135 kilowatts.\nTherefore, the answer is 135 kilowatts.",

By reducing the usage by 5 hours, the air conditioner will now be used for 3 hours, consuming 900 * 3 = 2700 watts or 2.7 kilowatts per day. The amount saved per day is 7.2 - 2.7 = 4.5 kilowatts.

            "Strategy:\nCalculate the increase in temperature while Marcus is baking, then calculate the decrease in temperature when the window is open. Finally, add or subtract the temperatures to find the final temperature.\n\nAnswer:\nAfter 3 hours of baking, the temperature increases by 15 degrees (3 hours x 5 degrees per hour). This brings the temperature to 55 degrees. When Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, the temperature decreases by 6 degrees (3 intervals of 10 minutes x 2 degrees per 10 minutes). Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.\n\nthe answer is 49."

            "Strategy:\nTo find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we need to calculate the total number of roses Ford needs to supply all three flower shops in a week. Then we will multiply this number by 4 to get the total roses needed per month. Finally, we will subtract this total from the number of roses Ford grows in a month (40 x 4).\n\nAnswer:\nFord needs to supply 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses per week to all three flower shops. \nIn a month, he needs 65 x 4 = 260 roses. \nFord grows 40 x 4 = 160 roses per month. \nTherefore, he lacks 260 - 160 = 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month. \nThe answer is 100."

Add these two totals together to find the total cost of John's research.\n\nAnswer:\nThe total funding needed for the first 5 months is $100,000. From month 6 onwards, the funding needed increases by 50% each month. Therefore, for month 6 it will be $100,000 * 1.5 = $150,000, for month 7 it will be $150,000 * 1.5 = $225,000, and so on. \n\nCalculating the total funding needed for the remaining 5 months:\nMonth 6: $150,000\nMonth 7: $225,000\nMonth 8: $337,500\nMonth 9: $506,250\nMonth 10: $759,375\n\nTotal funding needed for remaining 5 months = $150,000 + $225,000 + $337,500 + $506,250 + $759,375 = $1,978,125\n\nAdding the funding for the first 5 months to the funding for the remaining months:\nTotal research cost = $100,000 + $1,978,125 = $2,078,125\n\nTherefore, the cost of John's research is $2,078,125."

The sum of the capacities of the three trucks will be 11,600 pounds.\n\nAnswer:\nLet x be the number of pounds Gissela's truck can carry.\nThus, the capacity of Gordy's truck is x + 800 pounds.\nThe combined capacity of the three trucks is x + x + 800 + Gary's truck capacity = 4,000 + x + 800 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600.\nSolving for x, we get x = 2,600 pounds.\nThus, the capacity of Gordy's truck is 2,600 + 800 = 3,400 pounds.\nThe capacity of Gary's truck can be calculated as follows: 4,000 + 2,600 + 3,400 + Gary's truck capacity = 11,600.\nTherefore, Gary's truck can carry 1,600 pounds of gravel.\nSo, the answer is 1,600.",
