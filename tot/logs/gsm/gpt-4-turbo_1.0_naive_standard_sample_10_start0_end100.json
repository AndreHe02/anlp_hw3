Therefore, her running speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Running speed} = 3 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 = 6 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nDana's walking speed is one-fourth her running speed (since running is four times faster than walking). Thus, her walking speed is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Walking speed} = \\frac{6 \\text{ mph}}{4} = 1.5 \\text{ mph} \\]\n\nDana spends 6 hours total, with one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

Since the total amount is $1200, Dylan's investment is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{5} \\times 1200 = 480\n   \\]\n   So, Dylan invested $480.\n\n2. Calculate Frances' investment:\n   After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is:\n   \\[\n   1200 - 480 = 720\n   \\]\n   Frances invested \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) of this remaining amount. So, Frances' investment is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2}{3} \\times 720 = 480\n   \\]\n   Frances also invested $480.\n\n3. Calculate Skyler's investment:\n   After Frances' investment, the remaining amount is:\n   \\[\n   720 - 480 = 240\n   \\]\n   This final amount is what Skyler invested.\n\nThus, the answer is n, where n is the amount Skyler invested:\n   \\[\n   \\text{the answer is 240}\n   \\]",

The amount left, which is Skyler's investment, equals the original total minus Dylan's and Frances' investments:\n   \n   Skyler's investment = $1200 - ($480 + $480) = $1200 - $960 = $240.\n\nHence, the answer is 240.",
