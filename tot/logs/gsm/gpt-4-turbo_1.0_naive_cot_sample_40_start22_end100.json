Add the total salaries of junior and senior programmers to get the total monthly payroll for all programmers.\n\nAnswer:\n1. According to the problem, the company employs 100 people in total.\n2. The number of junior programmers is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the total employees. Therefore, the number of junior programmers = \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\times 100 = 40 \\).\n3. The number of senior programmers is the remainder of the total employees minus the number of junior programmers. Therefore, the number of senior programmers = 100 - 40 = 60.\n4. Junior programmers are each paid $2000 per month. Therefore, total payment to junior programmers = \\( 40 \\times 2000 = \\$80,000 \\).\n5. Senior programmers are each paid $400 more than junior programmers, so their salary is \\( 2000 + 400 = \\$2400 \\) per month.

            "Strategy:\nFirst, determine the number of junior programmers by calculating 2/5 of the total employees. Then, since senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, calculate the salary of the senior programmers. Next, determine the number of senior programmers by subtracting the number of junior programmers from the total employees. Multiply the number of junior programmers by their salary, and senior programmers by their salary, to find the total salary expense for each group. Finally, add these two amounts together to get the total amount of money the company pays to all its programmers per month.\n\nAnswer:\nThe total number of employees is 100. The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of 100, which equals 40. Since junior programmers earn $2000 per month, the salary for senior programmers is $2000 + $400 = $2400 per month.\n\nThe number of senior programmers then is 100 - 40 = 60. \n\nTotal monthly payment to junior programmers is 40 junior programmers x $2000 = $80,000. \nTotal monthly payment to senior programmers is 60 senior programmers x $2400 = $144,000.\n\nAdding these two amounts, the total monthly payment the company makes to all programmers is $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000.\n\nThus, the answer is 224000.",

Multiply the daily savings in kilowatts by 30 days to find the total energy saved over the month.\n\nAnswer:\nOriginally, Mel used his 900-watt air conditioner for 8 hours a day. So daily usage was:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ watts} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 7200 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\nAfter reducing the usage by 5 hours, the daily use becomes:\n\\[ 900 \\text{ watts} \\times (8 - 5) \\text{ hours} = 900 \\text{ watts} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 2700 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\nDaily savings in watt-hours:\n\\[ 7200 \\text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \\text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\nConverting watt-hours to kilowatt-hours (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts):\n\\[ 4500 \\text{ watt-hours} = 4.5 \\text{ kilowatt-hours} \\]\nTotal savings over 30 days:\n\\[ 4.5 \\text{ kilowatt-hours/day} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 135 \\text{ kilowatt-hours} \\]\nTherefore, by reducing the usage of the air conditioner by 5 hours a day for 30 days, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy. Hence, the answer is 135.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, determine the amount of energy used by the air conditioner under normal conditions (8 hours a day) and then compare it to the energy used when reduced by 5 hours a day. Remember that power is in watts and energy is in watt-hours. We need to convert this to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts). Calculate the energy saved daily by subtracting the two daily usage values. Then, multiply this daily savings by 30 to get the total energy savings over 30 days.\n\nAnswer:\nNormal daily energy usage of the air conditioner is calculated by multiplying the power usage (900 watts) by the time it is used (8 hours), resulting in 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh). When Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the air conditioner is used for 3 hours daily, which amounts to 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh. The daily energy saved by reducing 5 hours of use is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh. Over 30 days, the total energy saved is 4.5 kWh/day \u00d7 30 days = 135 kWh. Therefore, the answer is 135.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of energy saved by reducing the air conditioner's usage from 8 hours a day to 3 hours a day. First, we'll find the daily energy consumption in both scenarios (using 8 hours and using 3 hours). Then, we subtract the reduced daily usage from the original daily usage to find out how much energy is saved per day. After that, we'll multiply the daily savings by the number of days (30 days) to get the total energy saved over that period. Since the result needs to be in kilowatt-hours (kWh), we will convert from watt-hours (Wh) to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, calculate Mel's original daily energy consumption using the air conditioner:\n\\[ \\text{Energy per hour} = 900 \\text{ watts}\\]\n\\[ \\text{Daily energy usage} (8 \\text{ hours}) = 900 \\text{ watts} \\times 8 \\text{ hours} = 7200 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\n\nNext, calculate the reduced daily energy consumption:\n\\[ \\text{Daily energy usage} (3 \\text{ hours}) = 900 \\text{ watts} \\times 3 \\text{ hours} = 2700 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\n\nNow, find the daily energy savings:\n\\[ \\text{Daily savings} = 7200 \\text{ watt-hours} - 2700 \\text{ watt-hours} = 4500 \\text{ watt-hours} \\]\n\nConvert the daily savings to kilowatt-hours:\n\\[ \\text{Daily savings in kWh} = 4500 \\text{ watt-hours} \\, / \\, 1000 = 4.5 \\text{ kWh} \\]\n\nFinally, calculate the total savings for 30 days:\n\\[ \\text{Total savings} = 4.5 \\text{ kWh} \\times 30 \\text{ days} = 135 \\text{ kWh} \\]\n\nTherefore, by reducing the usage of his air conditioner, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

The difference between these two values gives the energy saved per day in kilowatt-hours. Multiplying this daily savings by 30 days gives the total kilowatts of energy saved over that period.\n\n1. Calculate the energy used per day initially: Multiply the power of the air conditioner (in kilowatts) by the number of hours it is used per day. Since 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts, the air conditioner\u2019s power is 0.9 kilowatts (900 watts = 0.9 kW). Initially, it is used for 8 hours, so the energy usage is 0.9 kW \u00d7 8 hours = 7.2 kilowatt-hours.\n\n2.

The new daily energy consumption would then be: 900 watts \u00d7 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours per day, which is 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day.\n\nThe daily energy saving when reducing the AC usage by 5 hours per day is: 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours. \n\nMultiply this daily savings by 30 to find the total savings for the month: 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day \u00d7 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.\n\nThus, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days by reducing the usage of his AC by 5 hours daily, the answer is 135.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find the energy saved by reducing the daily usage of the air conditioner, I'll first determine how much energy is used per hour and then calculate the total for the reduced hours per day over the specified period (30 days). I'll convert the energy from watts to kilowatts since the question asks for the answer in kilowatts.\n\n1. Calculate the amount of energy used by the air conditioner in watts per hour, and then convert it to kilowatts (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts).\n2. Determine the total hours the AC would have been used without the reduction.\n3. Calculate the new total hours after the reduction.\n4. Find the difference in hours before and after the reduction.\n5. Calculate the total energy saved in kilowatt-hours by multiplying the difference in hours by the energy usage per hour in kilowatts.\n6. Present the final saving over 30 days.\n\nAnswer:\n1. The energy used per hour by the air conditioner is 900 watts, or 0.9 kilowatts (since 900 watts \u00f7 1000 = 0.9 kilowatts).\n2. Initially, the total hours of AC use per day without reduction would have been 8 hours.\n3. With a reduction of 5 hours per day, the new usage is 3 hours per day (8 - 5 = 3 hours).\n4. The total hours saved per day are 5 hours.\n5. Over 30 days, the hours saved = 5 hours/day \u00d7 30 days = 150 hours.\n6. The total energy saved in kilowatt-hours = 150 hours \u00d7 0.9 kilowatts/hour = 135 kilowatt-hours.\n\nSo, the total kilowatts of electric energy saved in 30 days is 135 kilowatt-hours; the answer is 135.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Determine the total watt-hour reduction for each day: Since reducing usage by 5 hours daily from an AC that uses 900 watts each hour, calculate the daily energy savings by multiplying the wattage (900 watts) by the reduction in hours (5 hours).\n2. Convert the daily savings to kilowatt-hours (kWh): Since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts, divide the daily savings in watt-hours by 1000 to convert to kilowatt-hours.\n3. Calculate the total energy savings for 30 days: Multiply the daily savings in kilowatt-hours by 30 days to find the total amount of energy saved over the month.\n4. Provide the final answer in kilowatt-hours.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, calculate the reduction in energy usage each day. Mel uses 900 watts per hour, and reducing use by 5 hours daily saves:\n900 watts/hour \u00d7 5 hours/day = 4500 watt-hours/day.\n\nNow, convert the daily savings from watts to kilowatts by dividing by 1000:\n4500 watt-hours/day \u00f7 1000 = 4.5 kWh/day.\n\nFinally, calculate the total energy savings over 30 days:\n4.5 kWh/day \u00d7 30 days = 135 kWh.\n\nTherefore, by reducing the use of his air conditioner, Mel will save 135 kilowatt-hours of electric energy in 30 days.

We do this by multiplying the wattage (900 watts) by the number of hours per day (8 hours).\n2. Convert the energy usage from watts to kilowatts, knowing that 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts.\n3. Calculate the revised daily energy consumption if the air conditioner is used for 3 hours a day (8 hours - 5 hours).\n4. Again, convert this energy usage from watts to kilowatts.\n5. Determine the daily savings in kilowatts by subtracting the new daily energy usage from the original daily energy usage.\n6. Find the total savings over 30 days by multiplying the daily savings by 30.\n\nAnswer:\nFirstly, Mel's air conditioner uses 900 watts per hour for 8 hours, which totals 900 watts * 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours per day. Converting this to kilowatts, we get 7200 watt-hours / 1000 = 7.2 kilowatt-hours per day.\n\nNext, if the air conditioner is used for only 3 hours a day, it consumes 900 watts * 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours per day, which is 2700 watt-hours / 1000 = 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day.\n\nThe daily savings in energy would be 7.2 kilowatt-hours - 2.7 kilowatt-hours = 4.5 kilowatt-hours per day.\n\nOver 30 days, the total savings would be 4.5 kilowatt-hours/day * 30 days = 135 kilowatt-hours.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 135.",

            "Strategy:\nTo answer this question, you start with the initial number of shoes. Then you need to calculate the total number of shoes added throughout the week and subtract the number of shoes he got rid of on Saturday. Since one pair equals two shoes, you convert pairs to individual shoes when calculating totals. After adjusting for the shoes added and removed, you will calculate his final tally on Sunday.\n\n1. Start with the initial number of shoes, which is 200.\n2. Calculate the number of shoes received each day that shoes were added:\n   - 5 pairs on Monday which equals 5 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 10 shoes\n   - 15 pairs on Wednesday which equals 15 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 30 shoes\n   - 30 pairs on Friday which equals 30 pairs * 2 shoes/pair = 60 shoes\n3. Sum the number of shoes added by those days within the week.\n4. Subtract the number of shoes he gets rid of on Saturday:\n   - 180 shoes on Saturday.\n5. Determine the net change (shoes added minus shoes removed) and apply it to the initial number of shoes.\n\nAnswer:\nStarting with Fireman Frank's initial 200 shoes, he gained:\n- 10 shoes on Monday,\n- 30 shoes on Wednesday,\n- and 60 shoes on Friday.\nThis gives a total of 10 + 30 + 60 = 100 shoes added. \nOn Saturday, he gets rid of 180 shoes. Therefore, the net change from Monday to Saturday is 100 shoes added - 180 shoes removed = -80 shoes.\nStarting from 200 shoes and adjusting by -80 shoes, Fireman Frank will have 200 - 80 = 120 shoes on Sunday.\nThus, the answer is 120.",

            "Strategy:\nTo calculate the height of the human pyramid, I'll consider the heights of all the cheerleaders involved. Since the cheerleaders of different heights need to be placed deliberately for stability, the shortest cheerleader (60 inches tall) will be placed at the top. The rest of the structure will likely utilize the taller cheerleaders (64 inches tall). Hence, the pyramid's height would be the cumulative height of these cheerleaders from base to top:\n1. Four cheerleaders on the bottom: use the height of one (they are all the same height when standing).\n2. Three cheerleaders on the shoulders of the four at the bottom: again, use the height of one.\n3. Two cheerleaders on the shoulders of the three in the middle row: add the height of one.\n4. The shortest cheerleader (60 inches tall) stands on the shoulders of the two in the third row.\n\nNow, convert all heights to feet for the final addition (1 foot = 12 inches). Add up the heights in layers, and that would be our final pyramid height.\n\nAnswer:\nThe calculation step-by-step would be:\n- Height of top cheerleader: 60 inches = 5 feet.\n- Height of middle row cheerleaders: 64 inches = 5.33 feet (approximately 5 feet 4 inches).\n- Height of bottom row cheerleaders: twice 64 inches = 10.67 feet (approximately 10 feet 8 inches).\n\nAdding these up, the pyramid's total height is 5 feet (top cheerleader) + 5.33 feet (middle two cheerleaders)  + 5.33 feet (bottom three cheerleaders) = 15.66 feet. Since each layer occupies the standing height of one row of cheerleaders, no additional height is between the layers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 16 feet, rounding up slightly for simplifications in decimal places and converting inches to feet for practical measures.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine the height of the human pyramid, we first need to assess the height of each level based on the cheerleaders' individual heights. Given that there are four classes of heights from tallest to the shortest cheerleader, and each taller group supports the next one directly above, we add the heights in a linear manner from the base to the top.\n\n1. Convert the heights from inches into feet since the outcome needs to be in feet. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.\n2. Sum the height of the base cheerleaders, mid-level cheerleaders, the cheerleaders at the next level, and the top cheerleader.\n3. Since the cheerleaders are standing on each other's shoulders, only the height of one cheerleader per level counts towards the total height (i.e., each level's contribution is the height of one cheerleader).\n\nWe then assume:\n- The first four cheerleaders on the bottom, the three standing above them, and the two above the three are all 64 inches tall each.\n- The 10th cheerleader, who is the shortest and stands at the very top, is 60 inches tall.\n\nBy converting these heights into feet and adding them up as described above, we can calculate the total height of the pyramid.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, converting the cheerleaders' heights:\n- A 64 inch tall person = 64/12 feet = 5.33 feet\n- A 60 inch tall person = 60/12 feet = 5 feet\n\nAdding the heights considering one cheerleader's height per level:\n- Height of four in the bottom, but only add one of their heights = 5.33 feet\n- Height of three in the second tier, but only add one of their heights = 5.33 feet\n- Height of two in the third tier, but only add one of their heights = 5.33 feet\n- Height of one at the top = 5 feet\n\nSumming all levels:\n5.33 feet + 5.33 feet + 5.33 feet + 5 feet = 21 feet\n\nThus, the answer is 21 feet.",
            "Strategy:\nTo calculate the height of the human pyramid, first determine each tier's addition to the total height. Since the pyramid stacks with cheerleaders standing on the shoulders of those in the tier below, only the legs of each cheerleader need to be considered in the height, as their bodies overlap. For simplicity, consider the average height of a cheerleader's legs to approximate the height added by each tier. Divide the total height of a cheerleader by 2 for leg height (as they are usually roughly half their total height). The top-layer cheerleader's height is given as 60 inches (5 feet), and for others, it's 64 inches (5.33 feet).\n1. Calculate each level's added height starting from the top.\n2. Sum up these heights to find the total height of the pyramid in feet.\n\nAnswer:\nAssuming each level contributes roughly the leg height of the cheerleaders at that level to the pyramid height:\n- Top level (height added by the shortest cheerleader, 60 inches, or 5 feet): approximate leg height = 30 inches (2.5 feet).\n- Second level (height added by the average height of the other cheerleaders, 64 inches, or 5.33 feet): approximate leg height = 32 inches (2.67 feet).\n- Bottom level (similarly height added by the average height of 64 inches): approximate leg height = 32 inches (2.67 feet).\n\nAdd the heights for a total pyramid height: 2.5 feet (top cheerleader) + 2.67 feet (second tier) + 2.67 feet (base tier) = 7.84 feet.\n\nThus, the answer is 7.84 feet rounded to the nearest whole number is approximately 8 feet. So, the answer is 8.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Convert the heights of the cheerleaders from inches to feet. Since each foot contains 12 inches, divide their heights by 12.\n2. Identify the total height added at each level of the pyramid:\n   - The cheerleaders on the base level stand directly on the ground, so their heights contribute directly, without stacking.\n   - The cheerleaders on the second level stand on the shoulders of the first tier, so their heights need to be added to the height of the first level.\n   - This pattern continues for each successive level, with the heights of the cheerleaders compounded on previous levels.\n3. Since it's stated that the shortest girl (60\" tall) is at the top of the pyramid, she does not contribute to building the height of the lower levels. So, she merely needs her height added to the stack created by the tiers below her.\n4. Add the heights of each level to find the total pyramid height.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Convert heights from inches to feet:\n   - Height of 9 cheerleaders = 64\" / 12 = 5.33 feet each.\n   - Height of the 10th cheerleader (shortest) = 60\" / 12 = 5 feet.\n   \n2. Human Pyramid Configuration:\n   - Bottom layer: The cheerleaders' average height does not affect stacking, but for the calculation for upper levels, it's important to note that 5.33 feet will be the adding height.\n   - Second layer: Three normal-height cheerleaders contribute an additional 5.33 feet each.\n   - Third layer: Two normal-height cheerleaders contribute another 5.33 feet each but stacked above the second layer.\n   - Fourth (top) layer: The shortest cheerleader provides another 5 feet.\n\n3. Calculate total pyramid height:\n   - Start with the bottom layer height of 5.33 feet (from the ground to the shoulders of the first level).\n   - Add the second layer (since they stand on shoulders, the total height will be 5.33 + 5.33 = 10.66 feet).\n   - Add the third layer (again, standing on the shoulders of the second layer, the total height will be 10.66 + 5.33 = 15.99 feet).\n   - Add the height of the shortest girl at the top from the shoulders of the third layer (15.99 + 5 foot = 20.99 feet).\n\nHence, the total height of the human pyramid, in feet, to the top of the shortest girl's head while she stands on top is approximately 21 feet when rounded. Thus, the answer is 21.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the total height when certain members are standing on shoulders of others, as described in the question. The height will be calculated by taking into consideration the height of the cheerleaders participating in each row of the pyramid:\n\n1. Since the pyramid consists of different levels, and the cheerleaders stand on each other's shoulders, we will consider the height of only the bottom-most cheerleaders (or cheerleader) for every subsequent layer above the ground level. \n\n2. The heights of the individuals on each level will be summed up, starting from the ground:\n   - The first (bottom) level has 4 cheerleaders but only their height (once) is counted.\n   - The second level consists of 3 cheerleaders; add their height to the total.\n   - The third level has 2 cheerleaders; add their height to the total.\n   - The fourth (top) level has the shortest cheerleader; add her height to the total.\n\n3. Convert the final height from inches into feet for the answer, knowing that 12 inches equals 1 foot.\n\nAnswer:\nTo start, each row, except the very top one, will have the height of a 64-inch cheerleader as these are the majority. Here's the breakdown:\n\n- The bottom row: Since there are cheerleaders standing on them, their height is not added more than once, so only count 64 inches.\n- Second row: We add another 64 inches because three 64-inch tall cheerleaders stand on the previous row.\n- Third row: Add another 64 inches for two more 64-inch tall cheerleaders.\n- Top level: Add 60 inches for the shortest cheerleader who stands alone at the top.\n\nTo find the total height in inches:\n64 inches (bottom) + 64 inches (second level) + 64 inches (third level) + 60 inches (top level) = 252 inches.\n\nConverting this into feet:\n252 inches / 12 inches per foot = 21 feet.\n\nThus, the height of the human pyramid is 21 feet. Therefore, the answer is 21.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine the height of the human pyramid, we must consider the arrangement of the cheerleaders and their respective heights. Since the pyramid is composed of four levels, we need to add up the heights, level by level, starting with the tallest cheerleaders on the bottom and ending with the shortest cheerleader at the top. The cheerleaders' heights will not be added together across the members of the same level, as they are standing next to each other, not on top of each other. \n\n1. Convert the cheerleaders' heights from inches to feet (1 foot = 12 inches).\n2. Since the pyramid structure places the cheerleaders from the tallest to the shortest, we need to account for each level's actual added height based on cheerleader arrangements:\n   - Bottom level: occupied by four cheerleaders, but since they're on the ground, their height isn't added to the pyramid's height.\n   - Second level: three cheerleaders on the shoulders of the bottom level, adding one standing height to the pyramid. Use the average height since all are the same.\n   - Third level: two cheerleaders adding another cheerleader's height. Use the average height again.\n   - Top level: the shortest cheerleader adds her height.\n\nCalculate the total height by adding the standing height of one average cheerleader for each of the second and third levels plus the shortest cheerleader's height.\n\nAnswer:\nFor the pyramid construction:\n- Average height for the 9 tall cheerleaders: 64 inches.\n- Height of the shortest cheerleader: 60 inches.\n\nLevel calculations:\n- Level 1 (bottom): cheerleaders are standing, but their height does not add to the total pyramid height.\n- Level 2: based on the average height of the tall cheerleaders since all are the same, equating to 64 inches or 5.33 feet.\n- Level 3: repeating the average height, adding another 5.33 feet.\n- Level 4 (top): shortest girl's height, 60 inches equates to 5 feet.\n\nTotal height of the pyramid:\n5.33 (Level 2) + 5.33 (Level 3) + 5 (Level 4) = 15.66 feet.\n\nThus, the human pyramid stands approximately 16 feet tall, so the answer is 16.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve the problem, first convert the cheerleaders' heights from inches to feet for easier calculation relative to the total height of the human pyramid. There are height differences to consider, such as the shortest cheerleader, so assess the total height level by level:\n1. Convert the heights from inches to feet by dividing by 12 inches/foot.\n2. Align the cheerleaders in the pyramid based on the provided placement.\n3. Calculate the heights for each level of the human pyramid, summing them to find the total height.\n4. Confirm which levels are impacted by having the shortest cheerleader at the very top.\n\nAnswer:\n1. The height of a cheerleader is 64 inches, which converts to 64/12 = 5.33 feet, and the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches or 5 feet.\n2. In the pyramid, there are four levels. The base includes cheerleaders all equal in height, so the height is 5.33 feet.\n3. Each subsequent above level adds the height of the cheerleaders standing on the prior level.\n4. The height at the second level adds 5.33 feet to the first level, the third level adds 5.33 feet to the second, and the fourth level (top) adds another 5 feet.\n   - First level: 5.33 feet (height of the base cheerleaders)\n   - Second level: 5.33 feet + 5.33 feet = 10.66 feet\n   - Third level: 10.66 feet + 5.33 feet = 15.99 feet\n   - Fourth level (top): 15.99 feet + 5 feet = 20.99 feet\n\nHence, the human pyramid's height, rounded, is generally 21 feet.

The heights of the cheerleaders at each level of the pyramid, since only the heights of those at the base directly impact the positioning of others above them.\n2. The effective increase in height each subsequent level contributes to the total height of the pyramid.\n\nSince the shortest cheerleader (60\" tall, which is 5 feet) is at the top of the pyramid, we only need to consider the height of the top, or rather the sum of the heights of all cheerleaders she's directly or indirectly standing on.\n\nSince the height of the cheerleaders does not differ except for the topmost, who is also the shortest cheerleader, we can assume uniform heights for each layer\u2019s contribution except for the top. The other cheerleaders are 64\" tall (equivalent to 5.33 feet each). \n\nGiven that there are 3 levels below the shortest cheerleader:\n- The total height from the ground to the first layer (cheerleaders' feet to their heads) = 5.33 feet.\n- Assuming each standing level only adds the height of one cheerleader starting from their feet, we simply sum up 3 times the uniform height (since each level\u2019s head height contributes to the next level\u2019s foot height).\n\nAnswer:\nFirst layer height = 5.33 feet (64\" = 5.33 feet)\nSecond layer height = 5.33 feet (starting from the head of the first layer to the head of the second level)\nThird layer height = 5.33 feet (starting from the head of the second layer)\nTop (shortest cheerleader) height = 5 feet\n\nTotal pyramid height = 5.33 + 5.33 + 5.33 + 5 = 20.99 feet\n\nThus, the answer is 20.99.",

Since the question specifies the arrangement of cheerleaders in the pyramid (4 at the bottom, 3 in the middle, 2 in the next layer, and 1 at the top, who is the shortest), identify the height of the layers considering the tallest possible cheerleader in each layer except for the top-most layer.\n4. Add the heights of the shortest girl (at the top of the pyramid) to the height accumulated from the bottom to the next-to-top layer.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Convert cheerleaders' height from inches to feet: 64 inches is approximately 5.33 feet and 60 inches is 5 feet.\n2. Pyramid base layer (4 cheerleaders): Only height of the pyramid, not individual cheerleaders, since they are at ground level.\n3. Second layer (3 cheerleaders, all 64\" tall): add 5.33 feet.\n4. Third layer (2 cheerleaders, all 64\" tall): add another 5.33 feet.\n5. Top layer (shortest cheerleader, 60\" tall): add 5 feet.\n6. Total height of pyramid = 5.33 (second layer) + 5.33 (third layer) + 5 (top layer) = 15.66 feet.\nHence, the answer is 16 feet when rounded to the nearest whole number since 0.66 will round up, representing 8 inches (more than half a foot).",

            "Strategy:\nFirst, convert the height given in inches to feet by the standard conversion (1 foot = 12 inches). Next, calculate the height of each level of the pyramid by totaling the heights of the cheerleaders standing directly on top of each other, recognizing that the shortest cheerleader, being 60\" tall, will be at the top. Add up the heights in feet for each level to ascertain the total height of the human pyramid.\n\nAnswer:\nStart by converting the height of each cheerleader from inches to feet: \n- 64 inches = 64/12 = 5.333 feet \n- 60 inches = 60/12 = 5 feet\n\nSince the pyramid is built from the bottom to the top with each level standing on the shoulders of the level below, calculate as follows:\n- First level (bottom four) = 5.333 feet (as they are on the ground and not adding height)\n- Second level (three on top of the first level, each 5.333 feet tall) adds another 5.333 feet\n- Third level (two on top of the second level, each 5.333 feet tall) adds another 5.333 feet\n- Fourth level (shortest cheerleader on top, 5 feet) adds another 5 feet\n\nAdding all the heights together for each level:\n5.333 (first level) + 5.333 (second level) + 5.333 (third level) + 5 (fourth level) = 21 feet.\n\nTherefore, the total height of the human pyramid is 21 feet. Hence, the answer is 21.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, convert the heights mentioned from inches to feet. The base height of the cheerleaders is calculated by noting the tallest group participating, since they are the foundation and their height determines the overall structure's start. Multiply the converted height of the shorter cheerleader by the number of tiers in the pyramid minus the bottom one, as she is on top. Finally, add the height of the base layer of cheerleaders to the additional heights to get the total height of the pyramid.\n\nAnswer:\nThe height of a cheerleader who is 64 inches is 64 / 12 = 5.33 feet. The height of the shortest cheerleader (60 inches) converts to 60 / 12 = 5 feet. In the pyramid structure, the base layer is made up of girls who are 5.33 feet tall. Above this layer, the next layers do not add the full height of individual girls because they stand on shoulders; however, the height added is the height of the shortest cheerleader who is on the top. Therefore, the total pyramid height is 5.33 feet (base layer) + 5 feet (top tier, the shortest girl). So, the answer is 10.33 feet.",
            "Strategy:\nTo calculate the height of the human pyramid, I will:\n1. Convert the heights of the cheerleaders from inches to feet by dividing by 12 since there are 12 inches in a foot.\n2. Use the heights of the cheerleaders standing along the height of the pyramid. These will be the cheerleaders forming the vertical stack: one standing on the ground, another standing on her shoulders, another on the second's shoulders, and finally the shortest at the top.\n3. Sum their converted heights to get the total height of the pyramid.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, convert the heights from inches to feet:\n- Height of 9 cheerleaders: 64 inches = 64 / 12 = 5.33 feet.\n- Height of the shortest cheerleader: 60 inches = 60 / 12 = 5 feet.\n\nSince the pyramid is built with the shortest cheerleader at the top and one cheerleader's height stacked on top of another:\n- Using only the heights necessary for vertical stacking:\n  - Three cheerleaders at 5.33 feet each plus the shortest cheerleader on top.\n- Total height = (3 * 5.33 feet) + 5 feet = 15.99 + 5 = 20.99 feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 21.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find the total height of the human pyramid, we will calculate the number of levels (or layers) the cheerleaders form and then multiply by the height of a typical cheerleader standing on each level, as they will be contributing their full height to the total pyramid height. Given all cheerleaders except one are 64 inches tall (which is 5 feet and 4 inches), and the shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall (5 feet), it's logical to assume the shortest cheerleader stands at the topmost level. Therefore:\n\n1. Convert the height of the cheerleaders from inches to feet for easier summation.\n2. Calculate the total height by summing up the heights per level of the pyramid.\n\nAnswer:\nConverting 64 inches to feet (64 inches = 5 feet 4 inches \u2248 5.33 feet). The shortest girl with 60 inches is 5 feet. The pyramid consists of 4 levels:\n- At the bottom, cheerleaders contribute 5.33 feet each to the height.\n- Additionally, the next level adds the same 5.33 feet from other cheerleaders.\n- The third level contributes another 5.33 feet.\n- The top level, where the shortest girl stands, adds 5 feet.\n\nSince each level is vertically stacked onto the previous ones, the true height of each layer does not double by each cheerleader's height as they're standing on top of each other. Thus, only the height contribution of one cheerleader per level counts. Hence, the pyramid's height equals the height of one cheerleader standing, which is 5.33 feet for most of the levels, except the top which adds 5 feet.\n\nConclusively, the height of the pyramid from the ground to the top is the tallest cheerleader's height, as each succeeding group of cheerleaders stands on the shoulders of the group directly beneath them. This is equal to the height of four cheerleaders, 3 of whom are 5.33 feet and the topmost is 5 feet. Therefore, the answer is 5.33 feet (as the tallest contributing factor to the pyramid's height), which is the answer.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the total height from the ground to the top girl in the pyramid. We'll calculate it by adding the heights of each layer in the pyramid. We'll assume that each layer of cheerleaders actually stands on the shoulders of the ones below them, so their total stacked height includes:\n1. The full height of the bottom layer\n2. Plus the full height of the next layer standing on the shoulders of the previous layer\n3. And so on until the shortest cheerleader who is at the top.\n\nSince each cheerleader adds her full height except for the bottom layer (which contributes just once to the height), the calculation will involve the height of bottom layer, the height of one cheerleader of the second bottom layer on their shoulder, then one from the third, and finally the height of the shortest cheerleader at the top.\n\nGiven:\n- 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall\n- 1 cheerleader is 60 inches tall (and stands at the top)\n\nAnswer:\nLet's calculate:\n1. The base layer does not add anything to the height above their own head-top, so it contributes 64 inches.\n2. The second layer adds another 64 inches.\n3. The third layer adds another 64 inches.\n4. The top cheerleader adds 60 inches.\n\nTotal height in inches = 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 inches.\n\nSince 1 foot = 12 inches, convert inches to feet:\nTotal height in feet = 252 inches / 12 inches per foot = 21 feet.\n\nTherefore, the human pyramid's total height in feet is 21, hence the answer is 21.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine the height of the human pyramid, I need to consider:\n1. The height of every tier in the pyramid, as only the cheerleaders' feet count towards each tier's height.\n2. Since the cheerleaders are human, it's logical that each upper tier starts from where the tier below ends.\n3. The heights of the cheerleaders: As indicated, 9 are 64\" tall, and 1 is 60\" tall \u2013 this shortest cheerleader is at the top of the pyramid. Therefore, each tier below her is comprised entirely of the 64\" tall cheerleaders.\n\nNow, I will calculate the total height:\n- Bottom tier (4 cheerleaders, all 64\" tall)\n- Second tier (3 cheerleaders, all 64\" tall, starting on the shoulders of the bottom tier)\n- Third tier (2 cheerleaders, all 64\" tall, on the shoulders of the second tier)\n- Top tier (1 cheerleader, who is 60\" tall, on the shoulders of the third tier)\n\nThe total height is essentially the height of one cheerleader (since the ones above stand on others' shoulders) plus the height of the shortest cheerleader at the top. Convert this total from inches to feet for the final answer.\n\nAnswer:\nEach tier adds the height of one cheerleader, except the topmost cheerleader's actual height is used. Therefore, the pyramid's height in inches would be from 3 tiers of 64 inches each, plus the 60 inches of the topmost, making it 64 + 64 + 64 + 60 = 252 inches. To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12. \n252 inches / 12 = 21 feet.\n\nThus, the answer is 21.",

To simplify the calculations knowing the cheerleaders' heights - 64 inches for 9 cheerleaders and 60 inches for one - convert these heights into feet (1 inch = 0.0833 feet).\n\nAnswer:\n1. Convert 64 inches and 60 inches to feet:\n   - 64 inches = 64 * 0.0833 \u2248 5.33 feet\n   - 60 inches = 60 * 0.0833 \u2248 5 feet\n\n2. Construct the pyramid:\n   - Bottom layer: 5.33 feet (cheerleaders are standing on the floor, no height is added on top of them)\n   - The second layer cheerleaders also stand at 5.33 feet, add their height to that of the first layer: 5.33 + 5.33 = 10.66 feet\n   - The third layer (two cheerleaders) also each have a height of 5.33 feet: 10.66 + 5.33 = 15.99 feet\n   - The top cheerleader (shortest, 5 feet): 15.99 + 5 = 20.99 feet\n\nHence, the height of the human pyramid in feet is approximately 20.99 feet.

The calculation will be structured as follows:\n1. Add the heights of each layer; consider only the incremental height added by each new layer (each standing on the shoulders of the layer below).\n2. Convert the total height from inches to feet for the final answer.\n\nAnswer:\nAll cheerleaders except for the shortest are 64 inches tall. The shortest, who stands alone at the top, is 60 inches tall. \nCalculation considering each added layer:\n- First layer's height is effectively the ground level; thus, it contributes no additional height in calculation.\n- Second layer adds 64 inches (since they all are the same height except the one who is 60 inches and she is at the top).\n- Third layer again adds 64 inches.\n- Fourth layer (top) adds 60 inches.\n\nTotal inches = 64 (second layer) + 64 (third layer) + 60 (top layer) = 188 inches.\n\nNow, converting inches to feet (since 12 inches = 1 foot):\n188 inches / 12 inches per foot \u2248 15.67 feet.\n\nRounding this off, the answer is 16 feet.",

Divide the result by 2 to determine the cost of one monitor.\n\nAnswer:\n1. The cost of the computer is given as $1,100.\n2. The cost of the printer is $1,100 - $400 = $700.\n3. The combined cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800.\n4. Subtracting this from the total cost: $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. This is the combined cost for the 2 monitors.\n5.

Sum everything to get the final total.\n\nAnswer:\n- Full alphabet = 26 letters\n- Initial total letters = 2 * 26 + 13 = 52 + 13 = 65 letters.\n- After re-writing everything already written = 65 + 65 = 130 letters.\n\nTherefore, the total number of letters Elise writes is 130, so the answer is 130."

Subtract Ford's monthly rose production from the total monthly requirement of the flower shops to find out how many roses Ford lacks each month.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, sum up the number of roses ordered weekly:\n- First shop: 20 roses\n- Second shop: 15 roses\n- Third shop: 30 roses\nTotal roses needed weekly = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.\n\nNext, calculate the monthly requirement (assuming 4 weeks per month):\n65 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.\n\nCalculate how many roses Ford produces per month:\n40 roses/week * 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.\n\nLastly, determine the shortfall by comparing the number roses needed with the number Ford can provide:\n260 roses needed - 160 roses provided = 100 roses.\n\nTherefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month. The answer is 100.",
            "**Strategy:**\n1. Calculate total roses ordered by all flower shops per week by summing up the individual orders: 20 (first shop) + 15 (second shop) + 30 (third shop).\n2. Determine how many roses are grown by Ford per week.\n3. Subtract the total number of roses grown by Ford from the total number ordered per week to find how many roses he lacks per week.\n4. Since the question asks for the monthly shortage, multiply the weekly shortage by 4 (considering 4 weeks in a month).\n\n**Answer:**\nFirst, add up the roses ordered by the three flower shops in a week: 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses. Ford grows 40 roses every week. Therefore, each week Ford falls short by 65 - 40 = 25 roses. To find out the monthly shortage, I will multiply the weekly shortage by 4 (approximating that there are 4 weeks in a month): 25 roses/week \u00d7 4 weeks/month = 100 roses. So, the answer is 100.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, start by calculating the total number of roses demanded by the flower shops each week. Add the number of roses requested by each shop and then multiply the weekly deficit by the number of weeks in a month. Since a month typically has about 4 weeks, we will use this for our calculation.\n\n1. Calculate the total demand per week:\n   Sum of roses ordered by each flower shop = 20 (from the first shop) + 15 (from the second shop) + 30 (from the third shop) = 65 roses.\n\n2. Calculate Ford's weekly deficit:\n   Total roses demanded per week - Total roses Ford grows per week = 65 roses - 40 roses = 25 roses shortage per week.\n\n3. Calculate the monthly deficit:\n   Weekly deficit x Number of weeks in a month = 25 roses x 4 = 100 roses.\n\nAnswer:\nFord lacks 100 roses to fulfill the demands of the flower shops every month; therefore, the answer is 100.",

Calculate the total number of roses ordered by all flower shops in a week and in a month.\n3. Subtract the monthly production of roses from the monthly demand to find how many roses Ford lacks.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, I\u2019ll calculate Ford's weekly rose production, which is 40 roses. In a month (assuming 4 weeks per month), Ford grows 40 roses/week x 4 weeks/month = 160 roses/month.\n\nNext, let\u2019s calculate the total weekly demand:\n- First flower shop: 20 roses\n- Second flower shop: 15 roses\n- Third flower shop: 30 roses\nSumming these up gives a weekly demand of 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses/week.\n\nFor the monthly demand, multiply the weekly total by 4:\n65 roses/week x 4 weeks/month = 260 roses/month.\n\nFinally, subtract Ford\u2019s monthly production from the monthly demand:\n260 roses (demand) - 160 roses (supply) = 100 roses.\n\nFord lacks 100 roses to meet the demands of the flower shops every month, so the answer is 100.",

Finally, to find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill, subtract Jill\u2019s total earnings from John\u2019s total earnings.\n\nAnswer:\nJill worked a total of 3 hours over the weekend (2 hours on Saturday + 1 hour on Sunday). \n\nCalculating John's hours:\n- On Saturday, he worked twice as long as Jill, so he worked 2 hours \u00d7 2 = 4 hours.\n- On Sunday, he worked three times as long as Jill, so he worked 1 hour \u00d7 3 = 3 hours.\n\nJohn therefore worked a total of 7 hours (4 hours on Saturday + 3 hours on Sunday).\n\nCalculating earnings:\n- Jill's earnings = 3 hours \u00d7 $10/hour = $30.\n- John's earnings = 7 hours \u00d7 $10/hour = $70.\n\nTo find out how much more money John earned compared to Jill:\n- Difference in earnings = John's earnings - Jill's earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.\n\nTherefore, John earned $40 more than Jill, so the answer is 40.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total hours worked by John and Jill, respectively. Using the rates of pay and the information provided on the hours they worked, we can then compute their earnings. Finally, we will find the difference in earnings between John and Jill.\n\n1. Calculate Jill's total hours worked.\n2. Calculate John's total hours based on the information that he worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday and three times as long on Sunday.\n3. Determine total earnings for each using their hourly rate.\n4. Subtract Jill's earnings from John's earnings to find the difference.\n\nAnswer:\nJill worked 2 hours on Saturday + 1 hour on Sunday = 3 hours in total.\nJohn worked twice as long as Jill on Saturday, so 2 x 2 = 4 hours; and three times as long as Jill on Sunday, so 3 x 1 = 3 hours. Thus, John worked 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours in total.\n\nNext, calculate earnings:\n- Jill's earnings = 3 hours x $10/hour = $30.\n- John's earnings = 7 hours x $10/hour = $70.\n\nDifference in earnings = $70 - $30 = $40.\n\nThus, John earned $40 more than Jill, and the answer is 40."

Therefore, each month after the initial five months required:\n\\[100,000 \\div 5 = 20,000 \\quad (monthly funding)\\]\n\\[20,000 \\times 1.50 = 30,000 \\quad (\\text{new monthly funding with 50\\% increase})\\]\n\nThe total cost for these additional 45 months is:\n\\[45 \\times 30,000 = 1,350,000\\]\n\nCalculating the total funding now:\n\\[100,000 \\quad (\\text{initial 5 months})\\]\n\\[+ 1,350,000 \\quad (\\text{additional 45 months})\\]\n\\[= 1,450,000\\]\n\nThus, the total cost of John's research is $1,450,000, and the answer is 1450000.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Calculate the total duration of John's research. According to the problem statement, it initially takes 5 months but eventually takes 10 times longer, hence 10 x 5 = 50 months.\n2. Determine the funds used for the first 5 months at the original rate of funding.\n3. Identify the cost per month for the remaining months, which is stated to be 50% more than the original monthly funding.\n4. Calculate the total funds used for the remaining 45 months (50 - 5 = 45) at this increased funding rate.\n5. Sum the total funds from the first and the latter periods to find the total cost of the research.\n\nAnswer:\nThe initial funding provided to John was $100,000 for the first 5 months, so the monthly funding during this period was $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.\n\nGiven that every month after the first 5 months took 50% more funding per month than the initial rate, the new monthly funding rate would be $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $30,000 per month.\n\nThe number of months the research extended beyond the initial 5 months is 50 - 5 = 45 months.\n\nThe funding for these additional 45 months would therefore be 45 months x $30,000/month = $1,350,000.\n\nAdding the amount spent in the first 5 months, we get $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.\n\nThus, the total cost of John's research was $1,450,000. So, the answer is 1450000.",
            "Strategy:\nTo calculate the total research cost, let's start by dividing the task as follows:\n\n1. Calculate costs for the first initial months where the funding is constant.\n2. Estimate the prolonged period of research, which is 10 times the initially planned duration. Subtract the initial months to find out how many months were funded at the higher rate.\n3. Calculate the new funding rate for the extended months and apply it to the period calculated in step 2.\n4. Sum the costs from both periods to get the total research cost.\n\nAnswer:\nInitially, John was given a budget of $100,000 for 5 months, so for the first 5 months, the total cost is $100,000.\n\nThe total duration was 10 times the initial estimate, so the research lasted 5 months initially + (10 * 5 months) = 50 months. Therefore, the extended period is 50 months - 5 initial months = 45 months.\n\nDuring these 45 months, each month received 50% more funding than the initial monthly rate. The initial monthly rate was $100,000 for 5 months, which makes it $20,000 per month. Thus, the new monthly funding for these 45 months is 150% of $20,000, which is $30,000 per month.\n\nFor these 45 months, at $30,000 per month, the funding amounted to 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.\n\nAdding the initial funding and the additional funding, we have $100,000 (initial 5 months) + $1,350,000 (next 45 months) = $1,450,000.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of John's research was $1,450,000. The answer is 1450000.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Calculate the total duration of the research: The initial estimate is 5 months, but it actually takes 10 times longer. Therefore, the research duration is 10 * 5 = 50 months.\n2. Calculate the cost for the initial 5 months: This is straightforward since he was provided $100,000 specifically for these 5 months.\n3. Determine the cost per month after the initial 5 months: Each month after the first 5 costs 50% more than what was originally planned per month. The initial rate was $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month. Thus, each subsequent month costs 150% of $20,000, which equates to $30,000 per month.\n4. Calculate the funding needed for the remaining months (months 6 to 50): There are 50 - 5 = 45 additional months. So the cost for these months is 45 months * $30,000/month. \n5. Sum the costs from the initial 5 months and the additional 45 months to obtain the total cost of the research.\n\nAnswer:\n- Cost for first 5 months: $100,000 \n- Cost for additional 45 months: 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000\nCombining both costs, the total research cost is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000. \nTherefore, the answer is $1,450,000.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Compute the total number of months John spent on his research.

According to the question, he received $100,000 for these 5 months.\n3. Determine the monthly funding after the initial 5 months. As the funding increased by 50% per month, it becomes 100,000 x 1.5 = $150,000 per month.\n4. Calculate the total funding for the remaining period of research. The remaining period is 50 - 5 = 45 months. Thus, total funding for the remaining 45 months is 45 x $150,000.\n5. Add the funding for the first 5 months and the funding for the remaining 45 months to get the total research cost.\n\nAnswer:\nTo find the total duration of the research, we multiply the planned duration of 5 months by 10, getting 50 months. The funding for the initial 5 months was $100,000. For each of the remaining months, the funding was 50% more than during the first 5 months; therefore, it was $150,000 per month. We calculate the total cost for the remaining 45 months as 45 months x $150,000/month = $6,750,000. Adding this to the initial funding of $100,000 provides the total cost of the research as $100,000 (initial) + $6,750,000 (remaining) = $6,850,000. Therefore, the answer is 6850000.",

Calculate the funding required for each month after the initial planned period, which increased by 50%.\n4. Add up the funding for all months (initial period and the extended period) to find out the total cost of the research.\n\nAnswer:\nJohn initially planned for 5 months of research with a $100,000 budget. This means he received $100,000 for these 5 months. However, his research took 10 times longer than planned, so it lasted for 50 months in total.\n\nThe first 5 months cost = $100,000\n\nFor the remaining 45 months (50 total minus the initial 5), the funding required each month was 50% more than the average monthly funding of the initial period. The initial average monthly budget was $100,000 / 5 months = $20,000. Therefore, each of the additional months required $20,000 + (50% of $20,000) = $30,000.\n\nThe cost for the additional 45 months = 45 months * $30,000/month = $1,350,000.\n\nAdding the initial funding to the extended funding: \nTotal cost = Initial cost of $100,000 + Extended period cost of $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 1450000.",

Compute the total cost for both the initial and extended periods.\n4. Sum both costs for the final answer.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, calculate the total amount of months John spent on the research. Given his initial plan was 5 months, and it took 10 times longer, it results in 5 x 10 = 50 months total.\n\nNext, evaluate the additional months and their respective cost. The first 5 months were covered by the initial $100,000, equating to $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.\n\nFor the months after the initial 5, each month cost 50% more than during the initial period.

Sheila would have paid 20 pomegranates at $30 each = 20 * $30 = $600.\n4. Sheila's 10% discount on her purchase = 10% of $600 = $60. Therefore, Sheila's final payment = $600 - $60 = $540.\n5. The difference between their final payments = $540 (Sheila) - $398 (Clara) = $142.\n\nSo, the difference between the final prices paid on the two days is $142. The answer is 142.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find the difference between the total prices paid for the pomegranates on two different days, I will first calculate the total amount paid by Clara and then the total amount paid by Sheila:\n\n1. Calculate the total cost paid by Clara:\n   - Multiply the number of pomegranates by the price per pomegranate.\n   - Subtract any discounts given.\n\n2. Calculate the total cost paid by Sheila:\n   - Multiply the number of pomegranates by the price per pomegranate on the second day.\n   - Apply the specified percentage discount (10%) to get the final cost.\n\n3. Subtract the total cost paid by Clara from the total cost paid by Sheila to find the difference.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Clara's payment calculation:\n   - Number of pomegranates = 20, Price per pomegranate = $20.\n   - Total cost without discount = 20 * 20 = $400.\n   - Voucher discount = $2.\n   - Total cost paid by Clara = $400 - $2 = $398.\n\n2. Sheila's payment calculation:\n   - Number of pomegranates = 20, Price per pomegranate on the second day = $30.\n   - Total cost without discount = 20 * 30 = $600.\n   - Discount = 10% of $600 = $60.\n   - Total cost paid by Sheila = $600 - $60 = $540.\n\n3. The difference in total prices:\n   - Difference = $540 - $398 = $142.\n\nTherefore, the difference between the final prices Clara and Sheila paid for the pomegranates on two consecutive days is $142; the answer is 142.",

Next, I'll use the given total amount Manolo spent on candies and lollipops to identify how much he paid just for the candies by subtracting the cost of lollipops from the total. From this value, I'll find the cost of a single candy. Finally, I will calculate the cost for buying 10 lollipops and 10 candies based on unit prices obtained.\n\nAnswer:\nManolo purchased five lollipops at $0.40 each. So, the cost of the lollipops is 5 x $0.40 = $2.00. Therefore, the cost of four candies is $3.20 (total cost) - $2.00 (cost of lollipops) = $1.20. The cost for each candy is $1.20 / 4 = $0.30.\nNow, the cost of buying 10 lollipops would be 10 x $0.40 = $4.00, and the cost of buying 10 candies would be 10 x $0.30 = $3.00.
