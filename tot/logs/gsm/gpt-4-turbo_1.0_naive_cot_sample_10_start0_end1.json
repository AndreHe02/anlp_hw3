            "Strategy:\nFirst, calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks daily, which is already given as 16. Next, subtract the number of eggs Janet uses for breakfast and baking muffins from the total. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 for baking, which adds up to 7 eggs (3 for breakfast + 4 for muffins). Subtracting these used eggs from the total will give the number of eggs she has left to sell. Finally, calculate her earnings by multiplying the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg, which is $2.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet\u2019s ducks lay a total of 16 eggs daily. For her personal use, she uses 7 eggs (3 for breakfast + 4 for baking muffins). This leaves her with 16 - 7 = 9 eggs to sell at the farmers' market. Since each egg is sold for $2, her daily earnings from the eggs are 9 eggs \u00d7 $2 per egg = $18. Therefore, the answer is 18.",

Multiply the number of eggs intended for sale by the price per egg to calculate Janet's daily earnings from selling the eggs.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 for baking, which sums up to 7 eggs. Subtracting these from the total gives 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell. Selling each egg for $2 means she makes 9 x $2 = $18 at the farmers' market daily. Therefore, the answer is 18.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, first determine the total number of eggs laid per day by Janet's ducks, which is given as 16. Next, account for Janet's daily consumption and use of these eggs: three are used for breakfast and four are used for baking muffins. Subtract these from the total to find out how many eggs are left for selling at the farmers' market. Multiply the remaining number of eggs by the selling price per egg to calculate her daily earnings from selling the eggs.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day.

Subtracting this from the total:\n16 eggs - 7 eggs = 9 eggs.\nShe sells these 9 eggs at $2 per egg at the farmers' market.\nSo, her daily earnings from selling the eggs are:\n9 eggs \u00d7 $2 per egg = $18.\nTherefore, the answer is 18.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine how much Janet makes daily at the farmer's market, the first step is to calculate the total number of eggs laid daily by Janet's ducks. Next, subtract the number of eggs used by Janet for her breakfast and those used for baking muffins from the daily total. The remainder of eggs is what Janet sells at the farmers' market. Multiplying the number of eggs sold by the price per egg will give the total daily income from selling eggs.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet\u2019s ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day. Every morning, she uses 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, adding up to 7 eggs used daily. Subtracting the 7 eggs used from the total 16 eggs laid:\n16 eggs - 7 eggs = 9 eggs. \nThese 9 eggs are sold at the farmers' market, with each priced at $2. Calculating her total daily earnings from egg sales:\n9 eggs \u00d7 $2/egg = $18.\nTherefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market from selling eggs. The answer is 18.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we'll first calculate how many eggs Janet uses each day for breakfast and baking muffins. We then subtract this number from her total daily egg production to determine how many she has left to sell at the farmers' market. Finally, we'll calculate how much money she makes by selling the remaining eggs at $2 each.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet uses 3 eggs for her breakfast and 4 eggs for baking muffins, adding up to 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used daily. Since her ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day, the number of eggs left for selling is 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. At $2 per egg, she makes 9 x $2 = $18 from selling eggs at the farmers' market every day. Therefore, the answer is 18.",

Finally, calculate the earnings from selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market at the specified price per egg.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking, totaling 7 eggs used daily. This means she has 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell at the farmers' market.
