We then find the total monthly salary for senior programmers by multiplying their count by their monthly pay. \\n\\nLastly, we sum both totals (junior and senior programmers’ salaries) to get the total monthly salary expenditure for all the programmers. \\n\\nAnswer:\\nFirst, calculate the number of junior programmers:\\n\\\\( Number\\\\ of\\\\ junior\\\\ programmers = \\\\frac{2}{5} \\\\times 100 = 40 \\\\)\\n\\nEach junior programmer earns $2000 per month, so:\\n\\\\( Total\\\\ salary\\\\ for\\\\ junior\\\\ programmers = 40 \\\\times 2000 = \\\\$80000 \\\\)\\n\\nSubtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees to find the number of senior programmers:\\n\\\\( Number\\\\ of\\\\ senior\\\\ programmers = 100 - 40 = 60 \\\\)\\n\\nSince each senior programmer earns $400 more than each junior programmer, their salary is:\\n\\\\( Salary\\\\ of\\\\ a\\\\ senior\\\\ programmer = 2000 + 400 = \\\\$2400 \\\\)\\n\\nSo, the total salary for all senior programmers is:\\n\\\\( Total\\\\ salary\\\\ for\\\\ senior\\\\ programmers = 60 \\\\times 2400 = \\\\$144000 \\\\)\\n\\nAdd the salaries for junior and senior programmers to find the total salary expenditure:\\n\\\\( Total\\\\ monthly\\\\ expenditure = 80000 + 144000 = \\\\$224000 \\\\)\\n\\nThus, the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month is $224000, and the answer is 224000.', \"Strategy:\\n1.

Remember that power is in watts and energy is in watt-hours. We need to convert this to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000 (since 1 kilowatt = 1000 watts). Calculate the energy saved daily by subtracting the two daily usage values. Then, multiply this daily savings by 30 to get the total energy savings over 30 days.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nNormal daily energy usage of the air conditioner is calculated by multiplying the power usage (900 watts) by the time it is used (8 hours), resulting in 7200 watt-hours or 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh). When Mel reduces the usage by 5 hours, the air conditioner is used for 3 hours daily, which amounts to 2700 watt-hours or 2.7 kWh. The daily energy saved by reducing 5 hours of use is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh. Over 30 days, the total energy saved is 4.5 kWh/day × 30 days = 135 kWh.

The problem provides the total number of animal heads (i.e., the total number of camels and dromedaries) as 180 and the total number of humps as 304.\\n\\nLet:\\n- \\\\( c \\\\) represent the number of camels\\n- \\\\( d \\\\) represent the number of dromedaries\\n\\nThe equations derived from the problem statement are:\\n1. \\\\( c + d = 180 \\\\) (since the total number of camels and dromedaries equals the total number of heads)\\n2. \\\\( 2c + d = 304 \\\\) (since each camel contributes two humps and each dromedary contributes one hump)\\n\\nSolving these equations will give us the numbers of camels and dromedaries.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nUse equation 1 to express \\\\( d \\\\) in terms of \\\\( c \\\\):\\n\\\\[ d = 180 - c \\\\]\\n\\nSubstitute this expression for \\\\( d \\\\) in equation 2:\\n\\\\[ 2c + (180 - c) = 304 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ 2c + 180 - c = 304 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ c = 304 - 180 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ c = 124 \\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( d = 180 - c \\\\):\\n\\\\[ d = 180 - 124 \\\\]\\n\\\\[ d = 56 \\\\]\\n\\nTherefore, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd; the answer is 56.', \"Strategy:\\nTo solve this problem, let's define two variables: let \\\\(x\\\\) be the number of camels and \\\\(y\\\\) be the number of dromedaries. We know that each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump. Additionally, camels and dromedaries together make up a total of 180 heads. Therefore:\\n1. \\\\(x + y = 180\\\\) (since each animal, whether a camel or a dromedary, has one head).\\n2. For the humps, considering camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each, we can write the equation \\\\(2x + y = 304\\\\).\\n\\nTo find the solution, I'll substitute \\\\(y\\\\) from the first equation into the second equation and solve for \\\\(x\\\\):\\n\\\\[y = 180 - x\\\\]\\n\\\\[2x + (180 - x) = 304\\\\]\\n\\\\[2x + 180 - x = 304\\\\]\\n\\\\[x = 304 - 180\\\\]\\n\\\\[x = 124\\\\]\\n\\nSubstituting \\\\(x = 124\\\\) back into the first equation:\\n\\\\[124 + y = 180\\\\]\\n\\\\[y = 180 - 124\\\\]\\n\\\\[y = 56\\\\]\\n\\nSo, there are 56 dromedaries in the herd.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nThere are 56 dromedaries in the herd; the answer is 56.\"], 'infos': [{'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}, {'r': 1}], 'usage_so_far': {'completion_tokens': 106901, 'prompt_tokens': 2638, 'cost': 3.2334099999999997}}, {'idx': 33, 'ys': [\"Strategy:\\nTo solve the question, initially we identify the number of letters in Indras' name which is given as 6.

Convert the total height from inches to feet using the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches, as the question requires the answer in feet.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nTo start, the height of the cheerleaders:\\n- 9 cheerleaders are 64 inches tall.\\n- 1 cheerleader (the shortest) is 60 inches tall and is at the top of the pyramid.\\n\\nOrganizing the pyramid from bottom to top:\\n- Bottom layer: Any 4 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall. Height = 64 inches.\\n- Second layer: Any 3 of the remaining 64 inches tall cheerleaders. Height (accumulative) = 64 (bottom layer) + 64 (second layer) = 128 inches.\\n- Third layer: Last 2 of the 64 inches tall cheerleaders. Height (accumulative) = 128 (first two layers) + 64 (third layer) = 192 inches.\\n- Top layer: The cheerleader who is 60 inches tall. Height (accumulative) = 192 (first three layers) + 60 = 252 inches.\\n\\nNow, converting to feet:\\n252 inches ÷ 12 inches/foot = 21 feet.\\n\\nThus, the height of the human pyramid is 21 feet.

Determine the heights of the cheerleaders: all except one are 64 inches tall, and the 10th cheerleader is 60 inches tall.\\n2. Recognize that the height of the pyramid is the sum of the heights of the cheerleaders standing in each layer, from the ground up, since only the legs up to the head of the cheerleaders in each successive layer contribute to the total height.\\n3. Calculate the standing height of one cheerleader - since they are 64 inches tall, this equals about 5 feet 4 inches and for the shortest, 5 feet.\\n4. Sum up the heights, layer by layer, ensuring to convert from inches to feet for easier comprehension.\\n5. State the final answer as the total height of the pyramid.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nIn calculating the height of the pyramid:\\n- The bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders, but their height doesn't fully add up since the next layer stands on their shoulders; we consider the full height of a typical cheerleader once, which is about 5 feet 4 inches.\\n- Since each layer's cheerleaders add approximately the height from feet to head of the cheerleader above, add approximately 5 feet 4 inches for the second layer.\\n- Add the same (about 5 feet 4 inches) for the third layer of 2 cheerleaders standing on the shoulders of the second layer.\\n- Finally, add the height of the shortest cheerleader, standing on the third layer, which is 5 feet.\\n\\nTotal pyramid height = 5 feet 4 inches + 5 feet 4 inches + 5 feet 4 inches + 5 feet.

Therefore, we have the equation M - 2 = (1/2*30) + 5.\\n\\nSolving the equations:\\nM - 2 = 15 + 5\\nM - 2 = 20\\nM = 22\\n\\nSubstitute M = 22 into J = M + 2 to find Jean's age:\\nJ = 22 + 2\\nJ = 24\\n\\nTherefore, Jean is 24 years old.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples from Tuesday, which is 2x.\\n\\nFrom selling the apples picked on Monday, Lucy made $56. Since each apple is sold at $4, she must have picked and sold 56 ÷ 4 = 14 apples on Monday.\\n\\nAssuming Lucy sold all the apples she picked over the three days, the total amount she made is given by:\\n$56 (Monday) + $4x (Tuesday) + $4(2x) (Wednesday) = $56 + $4x + $8x = $56 + $12x\\n\\nSince Lucy made $56 from selling the Monday apples, we have:\\n$56 = 14 apples x $4/apple\\n14 = 14x\\nx = 1\\n\\nTherefore, Lucy picked 1 apple on Tuesday and 2 apples on Wednesday.\\n\\nThe total number of apples picked over the three days is:\\n14 (Monday) + 1 (Tuesday) + 2 (Wednesday) = 17 apples\\n\\nSo, the answer is 17.\", 'Strategy:\\nFirst, calculate the total amount earned from selling apples on Tuesday and Wednesday by using the price per apple. Then, calculate how many apples Lucy picked on Wednesday. Finally, add up all the apples picked over the three days.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nLucy earned $48 from selling apples on Tuesday (12 apples x $4). On Wednesday, she picked 24 apples (double of 12). Therefore, Lucy picked a total of 12 + 24 = 36 apples over the three days. So, the answer is 36.', 'Strategy:\\n1. First, calculate how much Lucy earned on Tuesday and Wednesday by multiplying the number of apples picked on each day by the selling price.\\n2. Since we know that she earned $56 on Monday, we can use this information to find the total number of apples picked over the three days.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nOn Tuesday, Lucy earned $4 x 12 = $48\\nOn Wednesday, Lucy picked 12 x 2 = 24 apples and earned $4 x 24 = $96\\nTotal earnings over the three days = $56 + $48 + $96 = $200\\nTotal number of apples picked over the three days is $200/$4 = 50\\nTherefore, Lucy picked 12 + 24 + 14 = 50 apples over the three days. the answer is 50.', 'Strategy:\\n1.

Then, determine how much she earned in total by adding up the earnings from all three days. Finally, use the total earnings to calculate how many apples she sold in total.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nLucy earned $4 per apple on Tuesday, selling 12 apples for a total of $48. On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples from Tuesday, so she picked 24 apples and earned $96. Adding the $56 from Monday, Lucy earned a total of $200 over the three days. Since each apple was sold at $4, Lucy picked and sold a total of 50 apples over the three days.

Therefore, the total distance run by the three of them is 4 + 20 + (Lynn's distance) = 24 + (Lynn's distance) miles. Since the total distance is equal to the sum of each individual's distance run, we can write an equation:\\n\\n4 + 20 + Lynn's distance = 24 + Lynn's distance\\n24 = 24 + Lynn's distance - Lynn's distance\\n24 = 24\\n\\nThus, the answer to the question is Lynn ran 24 - 4 - 20 = 0 miles.

Reggie also ran 3 miles farther than Lynn, so Reggie ran x+3 miles. We can write an equation by adding up the distances each person ran: x + 4 + x + 3 + 20 = total distance.\\n\\nAnswer:\\nLynn ran x miles, Paisley ran 4 miles, and Reggie ran 20 miles. Adding up the distances, we get: x + 4 + x + 3 + 20 = total distance. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 27 = total distance. Since we know Paisley ran 4 miles, we can substitute that in: 2x + 27 = 4.
