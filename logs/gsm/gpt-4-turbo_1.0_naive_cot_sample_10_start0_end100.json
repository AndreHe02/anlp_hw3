            "Strategy:\nTo find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can work backwards using the information given:\n\n1. First, we consider the 5 vacuum cleaners she has left.\n2. Then calculate what was left before she sold half of them to the orange house. Since she sold half of what was left at the orange house, she had 2 times 5 (which she had left) before selling to the orange house.\n3. Before selling to the orange house, she sold 2 vacuum cleaners more at the red house, so add these back to the total before the orange house to get the total before the red house.\n4. Finally, calculate what she had before selling a third at the green house by reversing a third reduction (multiplying by 3 and dividing by 2, owing to selling 1/3 initially).\n\nBy calculating each of these steps, we can determine how many vacuum cleaners Melanie originally had.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners remaining after selling half of what was left to the orange house, meaning she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before selling to the orange house.\n2. She sold 2 additional vacuum cleaners at the red house; hence, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners before visiting the red house.\n3. As she sold a third at the green house, to find out how many she had before that, we reverse the operation: before the green house, the vacuum cleaners accounted for 2/3 of her original total. Hence, 12 was 2/3 of her original total, and to find the full amount, we solve 12 / (2/3) = 12 * (3/2) = 18.\n\nTherefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners. So, the answer is 18.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we need to reverse engineer the problem based on the information given: \n1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which can be represented as (1/3)x.\n2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, which is 2 + (1/3)x.\n3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. To find what was left before selling to the orange house, subtract the total sold up to that point from the initial amount: x - [(1/3)x + 2]. This amount is then halved to find how many were sold at the orange house: (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2).\n4. Finally, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.\n\nWe use this structured information to set up an equation representing the number of vacuum cleaners left after all transactions, and solve for x (the initial number of vacuum cleaners).\n\nAnswer:\nLet x be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with. Based on the transactions described:\n\nAt the green house, she sold (1/3)x of her vacuum cleaners.\nAt the red house, she sold 2 more than what she sold at the green house. Therefore, she sold (1/3)x + 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.\nThis means, until this point, she has sold (1/3)x + 2 + (1/3)x = (2/3)x + 2 vacuum cleaners.\nTo find the remaining vacuum cleaners before she went to the orange house: x - ((2/3)x + 2).\nShe then sold half of this remaining number at the orange house: (1/2)[x - (2/3)x - 2] = (1/2)[(1/3)x - 2].\n\nFinally, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after sale at the orange house:\nx - ((2/3)x + 2) - (1/2)[(1/3)x - 2] = 5.\n\nSimplify this equation:\nx - ((2/3)x + 2) - (1/6)x + 1 = 5.  \nx - (2/3)x - (1/6)x - 1 = 5.  \nCombine like terms: (6/6)x - (4/6)x - (1/6)x = 6.  \n(1/6)x = 6.\n\nTo find x: multiply both sides by 6:\nx = 6 * 6 = 36.\n\nMelanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners, so the answer is 36.",

            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we will:\n1. Determine Dana's running speed using the information provided about her skipping speed.\n2. Calculate Dana's walking speed from her running speed.\n3. Calculate the time spent running and walking based on the total time (6 hours).\n4. Calculate the distance Dana can cover while running and while walking using the corresponding speeds and times.\n5. Sum the distances covered while running and walking to find the total distance Dana can travel in six hours.\n\nAnswer:\nStep 1: Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, and this speed is described as half her running speed. Therefore, Dana can run at \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) miles per hour.\n\nStep 2: According to the statement, Dana runs at a speed four times faster than her walking speed. Thus, her walking speed is \\(6 \\div 4 = 1.5\\) miles per hour.\n\nStep 3: Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking within a total of 6 hours. Therefore, running time is \\((1/3) \\times 6 = 2\\) hours, and walking time is \\((2/3) \\times 6 = 4\\) hours.\n\nStep 4: Distance covered running = Running speed \\(\\times\\) Running time = \\(6 \\text{ mph} \\times 2 \\text{ hours} = 12\\) miles.\nDistance covered walking = Walking speed \\(\\times\\) Walking time = \\(1.5 \\text{ mph} \\times 4 \\text{ hours} = 6\\) miles.\n\nStep 5: Total distance Dana can travel = Distance running + Distance walking = \\(12 + 6 = 18\\) miles.\n\nThis means Dana can travel a total of 18 miles under these conditions, so the answer is 18."

Since the zookeeper orders bananas to last for two months, we will multiply the total monthly requirement by 2 to obtain the answer.\n\nAnswer:\nThe monthly banana requirement for each species is as follows:\n- Monkeys: 200 bananas\n- Gorillas: 400 bananas\n- Baboons: 100 bananas\n\nAdding these together gives:\n200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons) = 700 bananas\n\nThis is the total number of bananas needed per month. For a two month period, we multiply this amount by 2:\n700 bananas/month \u00d7 2 months = 1400 bananas\n\nThus, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months, so the answer is 1400."

Since 1 watt-hour (Wh) is the amount of energy used by a device that consumes 1 watt over the course of an hour, you can find the daily energy savings by multiplying the wattage of the air conditioner (900 watts) by the number of hours reduced (5 hours). This gives the daily energy savings in watt-hours. \n\nConvert the result to kilowatt-hours by dividing by 1000, since 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) equals 1000 watt-hours. Finally, multiply the daily kWh savings by the number of days in consideration (30 days) to get the total energy savings over the period.\n\nAnswer:\nDaily energy usage reduction = 900 watts * 5 hours = 4500 watt-hours\nConvert daily savings to kilowatts: 4500 watt-hours / 1000 = 4.5 kWh per day\nTotal energy saved in 30 days = 4.5 kWh/day * 30 days = 135 kWh\n\nThus, the answer is 135.",

Calculate the daily energy savings in kilowatts by subtracting the reduced daily consumption from the regular daily consumption.\n6. Multiply the daily kilowatt savings by 30 days to find the total energy saved over the month.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Daily energy consumption without reduction: \\(8 \\text{ hours/day} \\times 900 \\text{ watts} = 7200 \\text{ watt-hours/day}\\).\n2.

            "Strategy:\n1. First, calculate the energy consumption per day when the air conditioner is normally used for 8 hours. This value is found by multiplying the power of the air conditioner (900 watts) by the number of hours used (8 hours).\n2. Convert the daily energy consumption from watts to kilowatts, knowing that 1 kilowatt (kW) equals 1000 watts.\n3. Calculate the reduced daily energy consumption when the air conditioner usage is decreased by 5 hours. This is done by recalculating the energy use for only 3 hours daily.\n4.

Since 1 watt = 0.001 kilowatts, we convert the air conditioner's power usage from watts to kilowatts: 900 watts = 0.9 kilowatts. Then, determine the energy saved each day by multiplying the reduction in hours (5 hours) by the power in kilowatts (0.9 kW). This gives the daily energy savings in kWh.

            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, first calculate the total energy consumed by the air conditioner when used for 8 hours per day. This is done by multiplying the wattage of the air conditioner (900 watts) by the time it is used daily (8 hours). Convert this energy consumption from watts to kilowatts by dividing by 1000 since 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts. Similarly, calculate the energy consumed when the usage is reduced from 8 hours to 3 hours a day (8-5 hours), and convert this to kilowatts as well. Subtract the reduced usage energy from the original usage energy to determine the daily savings in kilowatts. Finally, multiply the daily kilowatt savings by 30 to find the total savings for 30 days.\n\nAnswer:\nInitially, the air conditioner uses 900 watts for 8 hours per day. This equals 900 watts x 8 hours = 7200 watt-hours per day, which is equal to 7.2 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per day (as 7200 watt-hours \u00f7 1000 = 7.2 kWh). After reducing the usage by 5 hours, the air conditioner is used for 3 hours per day, equating to 900 watts x 3 hours = 2700 watt-hours per day, or 2.7 kilowatt-hours per day. The daily savings in energy thus is 7.2 kWh - 2.7 kWh = 4.5 kWh. Over 30 days, the total energy saved is 4.5 kWh/day x 30 days = 135 kWh. Therefore, the answer is 135."

We start with the initial house temperature and then sequentially adjust it based on these events.\n\n1. Calculate the increase in temperature from the oven:\n   For each hour the oven is on, the temperature increases by 5 degrees. As the oven is on for 3 hours, the total increase will be 3 hours \u00d7 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees.\n\n2. Calculate the decrease in temperature from the window being open:\n   The window is open for 30 minutes, and for every 10 minutes it is open, the temperature decreases by 2 degrees.

Apply these changes to the initial house temperature:\n   Start with the initial temperature, add the increase from the oven, and subtract the decrease from the window being open.\n\nAnswer:\nMarcus' initial house temperature is 40 degrees. After using the oven for 3 hours, the temperature increases by 15 degrees, bringing it to 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees. Then, opening the window for 30 minutes decreases the temperature by 6 degrees, leading to a final temperature of 55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees.

Subtract the total decrease in temperature caused by the window from the temperature after the oven heating.\n6. Arrive at the final temperature after accounting for both the increase from the oven and the decrease from the window.\n\nAnswer:\nStarting with the house's initial temperature at 40 degrees, the use of the oven for 3 hours increases the temperature. Each hour raises the temperature by 5 degrees, so in 3 hours, the temperature goes up by \\(3 \\times 5 = 15\\) degrees. Adding this to the initial 40 degrees results in \\(40 + 15 = 55\\) degrees.\n\nNext, the window is open for 30 minutes, during which the temperature decreases. Since the temperature drops by 2 degrees every 10 minutes, in 30 minutes, it decreases by \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\) degrees. Subtracting 6 degrees from 55 degrees gives \\(55 - 6 = 49\\) degrees.\n\nSo, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees; the answer is 49.",

            "Strategy:\nTo determine the height of the human pyramid, we need to calculate the total height from the ground to the top of the pyramid. This will include:\n- The height of the first layer (4 girls on the bottom), which will just be the height of these tall cheerleaders since they support the other layers above them;\n- The height additions from the succeeding layers on top of the initial layer. For layers above the bottom ones, only the additional height of the girls in the standing position needs to be added.\n\nWe note that:\n- There are 3 layers above the bottom girls.\n- Since we're talking about a human pyramid, all the cheerleaders are standing upright.\n- All cheerleaders, except one, are 64 inches tall (which converts to 5.33 feet as 64 inches / 12 inches per foot).\n- The shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall (which converts to 5 feet).\n\nSince the pyramid layers directly add on top of each other, only the height of the individuals in each layer needs to be counted once. The rest of their bodies would align vertically forming a single column of height. The height of each cheerleader from the second layer onward effectively stacks directly on the top of the preceding layer's cheerleader height.\n\nThus the combined height of the pyramid is perhaps easier to calculate as:\n- Height of the first row (base) of cheerleaders plus\n- The standing height of the rest the layers (three girls, then two girls, then the shortest cheerleader on top).\n\nAnswer:\n- Height of 4 bottom cheerleaders (first layer): 5.33 feet\n- Height of 3 middle cheerleaders (second layer): 5.33 feet\n- Height of 2 top cheerleaders (third layer): 5.33 feet\n- Height of the single topmost (shortest) cheerleader: 5 feet\n\nAdding these heights gives us 5.33 + 5.33 + 5.33 + 5 = 21 feet.\nThus, the total height of the human pyramid is 21 feet.

            "Strategy:\nTo calculate the total height of the human pyramid, I will:\n1. Understand the structure of the human pyramid, which has four layers.\n2. Consider the height of each layer's addition based on the height of the cheerleaders. Since the shortest cheerleader is on top, each layer's height will be that of the cheerleader at its bottom-most level:\n   - The bottom layer has cheerleaders who are all 64 inches tall.\n   - The second layer is standing directly on the back/shoulders of the bottom layer. Assuming typical cheerleading practices, the cheerleader's feet would be positioned at around the shoulder height of the person below them. A typical human head is around 9 inches tall, adding to which the shoulders can be approximately 4 inches more. That's an additional height of around 64 (from head to foot) + 13 (from shoulders to head top of the layer below) inches.\n   - The third and topmost layer would follow the same logic, each placed on the layer immediately below them.\n3. Convert the total height from inches to feet since 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.\n\nAnswer:\n- Bottom layer height: 64 inches (as their feet are on the ground).\n- Second layer at: 64 inches (for cheerleaders on bottom) + 13 inches (additional estimate reaching approximately the shoulders of below layer) = 77 inches\n- Third layer at: 77 inches (second layer total) + 13 inches (additional height over second layer) = 90 inches\n- Top layer (shortest cheerleader) at: 90 inches (third layer total) + 13 inches (additional height over the third layer) = 103 inches\n\nNow, converting the total height in inches to feet:\n103 inches / 12 inches per foot = 8.58 feet\n\nTherefore, the highest point of the pyramid is approximately 8.6 feet. Thus, the answer is 8.6.",

Calculate the total height by summing up the heights of the cheerleaders at each tier, starting from the bottom tier (remember that each tier stands on the shoulders of the tier below).\n\nAnswer:\nEach cheerleader's height in feet:\n   - 64\" = 5.33 feet (64 divided by 12)\n   - 60\" = 5 feet\nEach tier's heights are as follows:\n   - Base tier (the first four cheerleaders): Not added to height calculation because they are the foundation.\n   - Second tier (three cheerleaders each 64\" tall): Stood upon the shoulders of the first, adding 5.33 feet.\n   - Third tier (two of the 64\" cheerleaders): They add another 5.33 feet being stood upon the second tier.\n   - Top tier is the shortest cheerleader (60\" tall): She adds another 5 feet on top of the third tier.\n\nTo calculate the total height of the pyramid:\nSum of the tier heights = height of the second tier + height of the third tier + height of the top cheerleader\n                         = 5.33 feet + 5.33 feet + 5 feet\n                         = 15.66 feet\n   \nThus, the height of the human pyramid is 15.66 feet.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15.66.",

Since each girl stands directly above those on the level below, the total height of the human pyramid will necessarily be the sum of the heights of one girl per each of these levels.

Build the pyramid layer by layer:\n   - Each layer's height is determined by the tallest cheerleader in that layer since the cheerleaders stand with their feet on the shoulders of those below.\n   - Start from the bottom layer, then add the next one up, and continue to the top.\n3. Sum the height of each layer to get the total height of the pyramid.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, convert the cheerleaders' heights from inches to feet.\n- Height of cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall = 64 inches * 0.0833 = 5.33 feet.\n- Height of the shortest cheerleader who is 60 inches tall = 60 inches * 0.0833 = 5 feet.\n\nNow, the human pyramid is structured as follows:\n- Bottom layer has 4 cheerleaders all at 5.33 feet each.\n- Second layer has 3 cheerleaders, also at 5.33 feet each.\n- Third layer has 2 cheerleaders at 5.33 feet each.\n- Fourth (top) layer has the shortest cheerleader, at 5 feet.\n\nSince each layer builds directly on top of the previous, the height includes just the tallest person from each layer because the subsequent layers stand on the top of the people below, not additively by height:\n\n- The first bottom layer adds 5.33 feet in height.\n- The second layer doesn't add any new height because it is on top of the first layer, but the height of the pyramid so far is 5.33 feet.\n- The third layer also doesn't add any new height but maintains the height at 5.33 feet.\n- The top layer, with the shortest girl at 5 feet, adds height from the shoulders of the third layer. Since her feet are on the shoulders, she would not be standing at her full height atop them, but rather her feet would be at roughly the head of the cheerleaders below (subtract approximately 1 foot for the head). Thus, 5.33 feet (height to the shoulder of the layer below) + 4 feet (approx. height of the 60\u201d girl from shoulders up) = 9.33 feet, but since she is shorter: 5.33 + 4 = 9.33 feet.\n\nThus, the total height of the human pyramid is 9.33 feet.

Since each layer adds to the total height, one needs to sum the heights of the cheerleaders, starting from the ground up to the top of the pyramid. Given all other cheerleaders except the top one are the same height, it makes the calculation slightly simpler. The heights are given in inches, but the final answer is required in feet. Hence, after calculating the total height in inches, the result needs to be converted from inches to feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot).\n\nAnswer:\nThe bottom four cheerleaders contribute effectively no height to the pyramid other than serving as the base. Since each level of the pyramid will effectively add the height of one cheerleader from the next level, we consider only those heights added by each subsequent level:\n1. The first level (ground level) consists of 4 cheerleaders, but their height does not add to the overall elevation since they are the base.\n2. The second level consists of 3 cheerleaders who are 64 inches tall each. \n3. The third level consists of 2 cheerleaders, again 64 inches tall each.\n4. The fourth level has the shortest cheerleader who is 60 inches tall.\n\nGiven that only the cheerleader who stands on top of others (from the second level upwards) contributes to the overall height of the pyramid, we only need to add together the heights of the cheerleaders from the second to the fourth level:\n- Topmost cheerleader contributes 60 inches.\n- Cheerleaders on second and third levels contribute 64 inches for each level.\n\nTotal height in inches = 64 (second level) + 64 (third level) + 60 (top level)\nTotal height in inches = 188 inches\n\nTo convert inches to feet:\nTotal height in feet = 188 inches \u00f7 12 inches/foot \u2248 15.67 feet \n\nHence, the height of the human pyramid in feet is approximately 15.67 feet. Therefore, the answer is 15.67.",
            "Strategy: \nFirst, decode the question about building a human pyramid. To know the height of the pyramid, one does not accumulate the heights of each person in the structure; instead, the measurement focuses on counting the heights stacked vertically. Since cheerleaders on each level stand on the shoulders or bases created by those beneath them, we consider their height additions relative to the standing level of the ground. Given the dimensions of the cheerleaders and their arrangement:\n\n1. All cheerleaders, except for the shortest one, have the same height of 64 inches.\n2. The pyramid's configuration means only the height of the cheerleaders in vertical alignment matters: three cheerleaders are vertically aligned, with the shortest on top.\n3. Convert the heights from inches to feet for clarity (12 inches = 1 foot).\n\nCalculating the pyramid\u2019s height involves adding the heights of the cheerleaders vertically aligned.\n- The height of the three cheerleaders (2 at 64 inches each, and 1 at 60 inches) needs to be converted to feet and added.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Calculate individual heights in feet:\n   - Each regular cheerleader is 64 inches tall, which equals 64 / 12 = approximately 5.33 feet.\n   - The shortest cheerleader is 60 inches tall, which equals 60 / 12 = 5 feet.\n\n2. Add these for the total height of the pyramid:\n   - Height = 5.33 (base level) + 5.33 (second level) + 5 (top level) = 15.66 feet.\n\nTherefore, the height of the human pyramid is 15.66 feet.

The bottom and intermediate layers contribute to the pyramid's total height by increasing the height up to their shoulders since the next layer stands on their shoulders.\n3. In cheerleading, it's typical for the shoulders to be around 80% of a person's full height, which will be used here for calculating the added height by each subsequent layer.\n\nAnswer:\nConvert heights to feet: \n- Average height (64 inches) = 64 / 12 = 5.33 feet\n- Shortest height (60 inches) = 60 / 12 = 5 feet\n\nCalculating the total height of the human pyramid:\n1.

We need to consider both the heights of the cheerleaders and how they are stacked in the pyramid. Given the placements and heights of the cheerleaders, only the heights of cheerleaders who form the base of each level up to the summit will directly contribute to the total vertical height of the pyramid.

Subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total weekly cost of bus trips to determine the savings.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet takes 2 bus trips per day and does this for 5 days a week, leading to 2 x 5 = 10 bus trips per week. Each trip costs $2.20, so the weekly cost for these trips is 10 x $2.20 = $22.00. The cost of a weekly bus pass is $20.00. By buying the bus pass, Janet would save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00. Therefore, the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find out how much Janet would save by buying a weekly bus pass instead of paying for each trip individually, I will first calculate the total cost of all the bus trips she takes in a week without the bus pass. This involves multiplying the number of trips she takes each day by the cost of each trip and then multiplying that daily total by the number of days she takes the bus in a week. Next, I'll subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from this total cost to find out her savings.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet takes 2 bus trips per day at a cost of $2.20 each, and she travels 5 days a week. Therefore, her daily spending on bus trips is:\n2 trips/day * $2.20/trip = $4.40/day.\n\nOver 5 days, her total spending on bus trips is:\n$4.40/day * 5 days = $22.00/week.\n\nThe weekly bus pass costs $20.00. Thus, by buying the bus pass, Janet would save:\n$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00 each week.\n\nSo, the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, calculate the total cost that Janet incurs from her bus trips for a full week. Since she takes two trips each day and rides the bus five days per week, multiply the number of trips per day by the number of days she rides the bus, then multiply this total number of trips by the cost per trip. Next, compare this total cost with the cost of the weekly bus pass to determine how much Janet would save by purchasing the pass.\n\nAnswer:\nJanet takes 2 bus trips per day, for 5 days a week, which totals 2 x 5 = 10 trips per week. Each trip costs $2.20, so the total cost per week on bus trips alone is 10 x $2.20 = $22.00. The weekly bus pass costs $20.00. Comparing these two amounts, if Janet spends $22.00 on trips and could spend $20.00 on a pass instead, she would save $22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00. Therefore, the answer is 2.",

Thus, the printer cost $1,100 - $400 = $700. The total cost of the computer and printer is $1,100 + $700 = $1,800. The combined cost of the 2 monitors is $2,400 - $1,800 = $600. Therefore, the cost of one monitor is $600 / 2 = $300. Hence, the answer is 300.",

To find out by how many cups Juan needs to reduce his intake, we subtract the recommended amount (4 cups) from Juan's current intake (20 cups).\n\nAnswer:\nJuan currently drinks 20 cups of coffee a day. The recommended daily intake is 4 cups. Therefore, he must reduce his coffee consumption by 20 - 4 = 16 cups. Hence, the answer is 16."

Therefore, the new monthly cost = $20,000 + ($20,000 * 0.5) = $30,000.\n\nTotal cost during the extended period (45 months):\n$30,000 * 45 = $1,350,000.\n\nAdding the initial cost and the extended costs gives:\n$100,000 (initial) + $1,350,000 (extended) = $1,450,000.\n\nThus, the total cost of John\u2019s research is $1,450,000. Hence, the answer is 1450000.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Determine the monthly funding rate: Initially, John receives $100,000 for 5 months. Therefore, the monthly rate is $100,000 divided by 5.\n2. Calculate the total initial funding period cost: Multiplying the monthly funding rate by 5 months gives the cost for the initial period.\n3. Calculate the length of the extended research period: The research took 10 times the initial estimate, so it required 10 times 5 months minus the initial 5 months.\n4. Calculate the new monthly rate for the extended period: The new monthly rate is 50% more than the initial monthly rate.\n5. Calculate the total cost for the extended period: Multiply the new monthly rate by the number of months in the extended period.\n6. Sum up the initial funding period cost and the extended period cost to get the total cost.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Initial funding monthly rate is $100,000 / 5 = $20,000 per month.\n2. Total initial period cost is $20,000 * 5 months = $100,000.\n3. The extended period length is (5 months * 10) - 5 months = 45 months.\n4. New monthly rate for the extended period is $20,000 + 0.5 * $20,000 = $30,000 per month.\n5. The total cost for the extended period is $30,000 * 45 months = $1,350,000.\n6. Therefore, the total research cost is $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.\n\nThe answer is 1450000."

Total the number of buttons Lorraine has after all trades.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Lorraine initially has 30 small stickers. She trades 90% of 30, which is 27 small stickers for large buttons. Every three small stickers can be exchanged for one large button, so:\n   - Number of large buttons gained from small stickers = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons\n\n2. For large stickers, Lorraine has 40 in total:\n   - 50% of 40 large stickers equals 20 stickers for large buttons, which equates directly to 20 large buttons.\n   - The remaining 50% equals another 20 stickers, but these are exchanged for small buttons at a rate of 3 small buttons per large sticker. Therefore:\n   - Small buttons gained from large stickers = 20 x 3 = 60 small buttons\n\n3. Summing up all buttons:\n   - Total large buttons = 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons\n   - Total small buttons = 60 small buttons\n\nThus, Lorraine ends up with 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons, and the answer is 89.",

Calculate how many large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons and how many she trades for small buttons, and then calculate the number of buttons received for each.\n3. Sum up all the buttons received from trading both small and large stickers to get the total number of buttons Lorraine ends up with.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Lorraine trades 90% of her 30 small stickers for large buttons. \n   90% of 30 small stickers = 27 small stickers.\n   Since 1 large button = 3 small stickers,\n   Number of large buttons Lorraine receives = 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.\n\n2.

Afterward, we can sum up the number of students who passed from all grades and divide it by the total number of students to get the overall pass rate.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, we know from the problem:\n- 340 out of 500 third-graders passed.\n- 40 out of 100 fourth graders passed.\n- The fifth graders' pass rate is double the fourth graders' pass rate.\n\nCalculating the pass rate for fourth graders:\nPass rate for 4th grade = (40 / 100) x 100 = 40%.\n\nSince the fifth graders' pass rate is twice that of the fourth graders, it's:\nPass rate for 5th grade = 2 x 40% = 80%.\n\nNext, calculate the number of fifth graders who passed:\nNumber of fifth graders passed = 80% of 400 = 0.8 x 400 = 320.\n\nNow, sum the passed students from all grades:\nTotal passed students = 340 (3rd grade) + 40 (4th grade) + 320 (5th grade) = 700.\n\nAnd, sum up the total number of students:\nTotal number of students = 500 (3rd grade) + 100 (4th grade) + 400 (5th grade) = 1000.\n\nFinally, calculate the overall pass rate:\nOverall pass rate = (Total passed students / Total number of students) x 100 = (700 / 1000) x 100 = 70%.\n\nThus, the answer is 70.",

The specific calculation follows a geometric sequence for each day as follows:\n\n- Day 0: The initial number of people infected is 10.\n- Day 1: Each of the initially infected 10 people infects 6 new people, leading to 10 * 6 additional infections.\n- Day 2: Each person infected on Day 1 (60 people) also infects 6 new people.\n- Day 3: Each person infected on Day 2 infects 6 more people.\n\nWe'll sum up all the people infected by the end of each day to get the total number after three days.\n\nAnswer:\nStarting with 10 people infected initially:\n\n- Day 0: 10 people are directly infected.\n- Day 1: 10 x 6 = 60 new infections. Total infected = 10 (previous total) + 60 = 70\n- Day 2: 60 x 6 = 360 new infections. Total infected = 70 (previous total) + 360 = 430\n- Day 3: 360 x 6 = 2160 new infections. Total infected = 430 (previous total) + 2160 = 2590\n\nTherefore, after three days, 2590 people are infected. Thus, the answer is 2590.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we can use an exponential growth model based on the information provided. Initially, there are ten infected people. Each day, every person who is already infected spreads the infection to six new people. We can calculate the number of people newly infected each day and then sum those with the initial number of infected individuals to find the total number of infected people after three days.\n\nLet's denote the total number of people infected after a certain number of days as I(day):\n- I(0), the initial number of infected people, equals 10.\n- On every subsequent day, the number of newly infected people is the number of people infected the previous day multiplied by six.\n\nSo, calculating for the first three days:\n- Day 1: I(1) = Previous total + (each person infects 6 new people)\n- Day 2: I(2) = Previous total + (each person infects 6 new people)\n- Day 3: I(3) = Previous total + (each person infects 6 new people)\n\nAnswer:\n- On day 0, initially, there are 10 infected individuals.\n- On day 1, these 10 individuals each infect 6 others, thus I(1) = 10 + (10 x 6) = 70 people are infected in total by the end of day 1.\n- On day 2, every person among the 70 now infects 6 more, so I(2) = 70 + (70 x 6) = 490 people are infected in total by the end of day 2.\n- On day 3, every person among the 490 infects 6 more, so I(3) = 490 + (490 x 6) = 3430 people are infected in total by the end of day 3.\n\nTherefore, the number of people infected after three days is 3430; the answer is 3430.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find out how many people are infected after three days, we recognize the problem as a geometric growth scenario, where each infected person spreads the infection to six new individuals each day. We start with an initial count of infected people and calculate the new infections for each subsequent day, then sum up all the infected people including those from previous days. Therefore, the formula to use is the sum of a geometric series:\n\n- Day 0: Initially infected = 10 (The initial count, I_0)\n- Day 1: New infections = 6 \u00d7 previous day's total infections (I_1 = 6 \u00d7 I_0)\n- Day 2: New infections = 6 \u00d7 previous day's total infections (I_2 = 6 \u00d7 I_1)\n- Day 3: New infections = 6 \u00d7 previous day's total infections (I_3 = 6 \u00d7 I_2)\n\nTotal infections by any day n = I_0 + I_1 + I_2 + ... + I_n.\n\nAnswer:\nStarting with 10 infected people:\n- Day 0: 10 persons (Initial)\n- Day 1: 10 + (6 \u00d7 10) = 70 persons\n- Day 2: 70 + (6 \u00d7 70) = 490 persons\n- Day 3: 490 + (6 \u00d7 490) = 3430 persons\n\nSo, after three days, a total of 3430 people are infected. Thus, the answer is 3430.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we will use an exponential growth calculation because every infected person infects six new individuals each day. The number of infections on any given day can be calculated by multiplying the total number of infections from the previous day by 6 (the number of people each infected person infects) and then adding the previous day's total number of infections, since they remain infected.\n\nWe start with:\n- Day 0: 10 infected individuals (initial condition)\n\nFor day 1:\n- Each of the initially infected ten people infects six more, therefore, 10 x 6 = 60 new infections.\n- Total infections by the end of day 1 = previous total + new infections = 10 + (10 x 6) = 10 + 60 = 70.\n\nFor day 2:\n- Each of the 70 infected people from day 1 infects six more, so 70 x 6 = 420 new infections.\n- Total infections by the end of day 2 = previous total + new infections = 70 + (70 x 6) = 70 + 420 = 490.\n\nFor day 3:\n- Each of the 490 infected people from day 2 infects six more, so 490 x 6 = 2940 new infections.\n- Total infections by the end of day 3 = previous total + new infections = 490 + (490 x 6) = 490 + 2940 = 3430.\n\nAnswer:\nThus, the total number of people infected after three days is 3430, so the answer is 3430.",
            "Strategy:\nThe problem is a classic example of exponential growth or geometric progression. The mechanism described in the problem statement suggests that the number of infected persons increases by a factor determined by the number of new people each already infected person infects daily.\n\n1. Let the initial number of infected people be \\( I_0 \\).\n2. Each day, every infected person infects six more people. Therefore, the number of new infections each day is given by the product of the number of currently infected people and six (the number of new infections one person generates).\n3. On the first day, the total number of infected people is the sum of the initial infections and the new infections from that day.\n4. This pattern continues for each subsequent day.\n\nTo compute the total number of infected people after three days:\n\n- Start with \\( I_0 = 10 \\) (initially infected people).\n- Compute the total number of infected people at the end of each day:\n  - Day 1: \\( I_1 = I_0 + 6 \\times I_0 \\)\n  - Day 2: \\( I_2 = I_1 + 6 \\times I_1 \\)\n  - Day 3: \\( I_3 = I_2 + 6 \\times I_2 \\)\n\nBy solving these expressions sequentially, we can get the total number of infected people after three days.\n\nAnswer:\nGiven:\n- Day 0 (initial): \\( I_0 = 10 \\)\n\n- Day 1: \\( I_1 = 10 + 6 \\times 10 = 10 + 60 = 70 \\)\n- Day 2: \\( I_2 = 70 + 6 \\times 70 = 70 + 420 = 490 \\)\n- Day 3: \\( I_3 = 490 + 6 \\times 490 = 490 + 2940 = 3430 \\)\n\nThus, after three days, a total of 3430 people are infected. Hence, the answer is 3430.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of individuals infected over the course of three days, given that each infected individual infects six new people every day. We start with a known initial number of infected individuals and progressively add the newly infected individuals each day. \n\nDay 0: Initial infected individuals\nDay 1: Each person from Day 0 infects 6 new people\nDay 2: Each person from Day 1 infects 6 new people\nDay 3: Each person from Day 2 infects 6 new people\n\nMathematically, we can calculate the total number of people infected on any day using the formula:\nInitial infected people * (6 ^ number of days)\n\nEach day's newly infected individuals need to be summed up with all previous days' totals to arrive at the grand total after three days.\n\nAnswer:\nInitially, 10 people are infected.\n\nDay 1: Each of these 10 infects 6 new people, so 10 * 6 = 60 new infections.\nDay 2: Each of the 60 new infected people from Day 1 infects 6 others, so 60 * 6 = 360 new infections.\nDay 3: Each of the 360 new infected people from Day 2 infects 6 others, so 360 * 6 = 2160 new infections.\n\nNow, we sum all the infections:\nInitial infections: 10\nDay 1 infections: 60\nDay 2 infections: 360\nDay 3 infections: 2160\n\nTotal infections after three days = 10 + 60 + 360 + 2160 = 2590\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2590."

Next, compute the cost if Cameron chose the 12-hour stay rate and then added 70 pesos for the remaining hours beyond the initial 12 hours. Finally, compare this total cost with the fixed 24-hour stay rate of 1600 pesos to find out how much Cameron saves by choosing the first option. Subtracting the cost of one approach from the cost of the other will give the amount saved.\n\nAnswer:\nCameron stays from 5 pm to 10 am; this is a total of 17 hours (12 hours until 5 am and an additional 5 hours until 10 am). The 12-hour rate is 1000 pesos. For the subsequent 5 hours, at 70 pesos an hour, the additional cost is 350 pesos (5 hours x 70 pesos/hour).

            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, we first identify the number of cherries each person receives. We already know that Robert has 30 cherries and that he has 10 more than Richard. Using this information, we can determine how many cherries Richard has. After knowing Robert's and Richard's shares, we can calculate how many cherries Jerry has by subtracting the sum of Robert's and Richard's cherries from the total number of cherries. Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry\u2019s share from Robert's share.\n\nAnswer:\nRobert has 30 cherries, and he has 10 more than Richard. Therefore, Richard has 30 - 10 = 20 cherries. The total number of cherries is 60. If we subtract the cherries that Robert and Richard have from the total, Jerry\u2019s share is 60 - (30 + 20) = 10 cherries. To find how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract Jerry's cherries from Robert\u2019s cherries: 30 - 10 = 20. Therefore, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry, so the answer is 20."

            "Strategy:\nTo solve this question, consider the breakdown of the meat distribution:\n1. The T-Rex eats half of the triceratops, leaving the other half.\n2. Then, the velociraptors eat half of the remaining half (which is one-quarter of the original weight).\n3. What's left after the velociraptors is gobbled by the Allosaurus, and this weight is given as 270 kilograms. This amount is the last remaining quarter of the triceratops, following the actions of the velociraptors.\n\nWe need to figure out the weight of the triceratops initially by using the remaining 270 kilograms as 1/4 of the total after the velociraptors ate their share:\n- This remaining quarter initially represented half the triceratops' total weight before the velociraptors ate their share. Therefore, doubling 270 kilograms gives us the weight after the T-Rex ate its half.\n- Doubling the result again provides the original total weight of the triceratops.\n\nAnswer:\nAfter the velociraptors, we are left with the last quarter (270 kg). Before the velociraptors ate, this weight represented half, so doubling 270 kg gives 540 kg, meaning this was the weight left after the T-Rex ate its half. To find the original weight, we double 540 kg, leading to 1080 kg. Thus, the triceratops originally weighed 1080 kilograms, so the answer is 1080.",
            "Strategy:\nFirstly, denote the initial weight of the triceratops as x. According to the problem, the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops, leaving x/2 kilograms. After that, the velociraptors ate half of the remaining meat, leaving x/2 - (x/2)/2 = x/4. Finally, the Allosaurus ate the remaining 270 kilograms. Therefore, the remaining meat after the velociraptors, which is x/4, equals 270 kilograms. From this, solve for x to determine the total initial weight of the triceratops.\n\nAnswer:\nAssuming that the Allosaurus ate the remaining 270 kilograms, which is x/4, we can set up the equation x/4 = 270. Solving for x gives:\nx = 270 * 4 = 1080 kilograms.\n\nTherefore, the initial weight of the triceratops was 1080 kilograms, and the answer is 1080.",
            "Strategy:\nThe question presents a sequence of events involving consumption of a triceratops by different dinosaurs, and the end result in quantity. The strategy is to backtrack from the known quantity and recalculating the original amount:\n1. Start from the known amount eaten by the Allosaurus, which was 270 kilograms.\n2. Note that this 270 kilograms represented the remaining amount of meat after the velociraptors had eaten half of what was left post-T-Rex feast.\n3. Double the 270 kilograms to get the amount of triceratops meat available immediately after the T-Rex ate. This accounts for the half taken by the velociraptors.\n4. The resulting quantity needs to be doubled again to account for the T-Rex eating half of the original full amount.\n\nAnswer:\nCalculate the quantity after Allosaurus: 270 kg (this is half of the triceratops meat post-raptor feast)\nMultiply by 2 to find the amount before Velociraptors scavenged: 270 kg x 2 = 540 kg\nMultiply by 2 to find the original amount before T-Rex ate: 540 kg x 2 = 1080 kg\nTherefore, the total amount of triceratops meat originally was 1080 kilograms. Hence, the answer is 1080.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find out the original weight of the triceratops, you can work backward from the information given:\n1. Begin by understanding that the group of Allosaurus ate what was left after the T-Rex and the velociraptors had their shares.\n2. Calculate the amount of triceratops meat left just before the Allosaurus arrived. Since they finished off the remaining meat (270 kg) and that represents half of what remained post-velociraptors, the amount of meat before the Allosaurus arrived must be 270 kg x 2 = 540 kg.\n3. Next, understand that the velociraptors ate half of the remaining triceratops meat after the T-Rex had its share. Therefore, before the velociraptors ate, there must have been 540 kg x 2 = 1080 kg left from the original triceratops.\n4. Finally, calculate the original amount of triceratops meat. Knowing that the T-Rex ate half of it, the whole original weight would be 1080 kg x 2 = 2160 kg.\n\nAnswer:\nBased on these calculations, the original weight of the triceratops before the Tyrannosaurus rex ate it was 2160 kg. Therefore, the answer is 2160.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Identify the initial amount of meat the triceratops has (which we'll denote as x kilograms).\n2. Express the sequence of events as mathematical operations based on x.\n3. Solve for x using the information about the amount of meat consumed at each stage:\n   - T-Rex eats half, leaving half: x/2.\n   - Velociraptors eat half of the remainder: (x/2)/2 = x/4.\n   - Allosaurus eat the remaining meat: x/4.\n   \n   Given that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms, we know:\n   x/4 = 270 kilograms.\n\n4. Calculate the initial amount of meat by solving the equation x/4 = 270 kg.\n\nAnswer:\nFollowing the strategy, we set up the equation based on the last amount of meat known: x/4 = 270 kg. To solve for x, multiply both sides of the equation by 4:\nx = 270 kg \u00d7 4 = 1080 kg.\n\nTherefore, the total amount of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate was 1080 kg. Thus, the answer is 1080.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve the problem, let's use backward reasoning from the amount of meat the lazy Allosaurus consumed. If they ate the last 270 kilograms, it means that what was consumed by the Allosaurus was one half of the amount left after the velociraptors scavenged. Therefore, before the Allosaurus, there was twice the amount of what they ate, i.e., 2 * 270 kg. Using the same reasoning for the velociraptors, we find the amount left after the T-Rex ate, and then calculate what the T-Rex ate, doubling the amount after it to find the original quantity of meat on the triceratops.\n\nAnswer:\nStarting from what the lazy Allosaurus consumed, which was 270 kilograms, this was only half of what was left, indicating that before the Allosaurus ate, there was 2 * 270 kg = 540 kg of meat left. Following the same logic, the velociraptors scavenged half of the meat, suggesting that after the T-Rex ate and just before the velociraptors scavenged, there was 2 * 540 kg = 1080 kg of meat left. As the T-Rex ate half of the original triceratops, the original weight of meat on the triceratops was 2 * 1080 kg = 2160 kg. Therefore, the answer is 2160.",

Velociraptors ate half of what was left by the T-rex, hence they ate 1/4 X, leaving 1/4 X.\n4. The Allosaurus then ate the remaining meat, which is given as 270 kg.\n5. Set up the equation 1/4 X = 270, to find the total initial weight of the triceratops (X).\n6.

Subtract the number of women who alight from the bus (20) from the initial number of women to find how many women remain on the bus.\n\nAnswer:\nTo begin, consider the ratio of men to women as 5:9. This means that for every 14 people (because 5 men + 9 women = 14 people), 5 are men and 9 are women. \n\nLet \\( x \\) be the multiplier for the ratio.

The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple, which gives us 2 pints each. Thus, the amount of red paint used was 2 pints, so the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve the problem, start by understanding the distribution of paint. It's mentioned that half of the mural is painted yellow, so we know right away that 50% of the total paint used is yellow. Since the total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints, half of this, or 6 pints, is yellow. The remaining three colors (red, white, and purple) together use the other half of the paint, which is also 6 pints. Since the problem states that the amounts of red, white, and purple paint are equal, each of these three colors uses one-third of the 6 pints. \n\nAnswer:\nCalculate one-third of 6 pints to find the amount of red paint used. One-third of 6 pints is 2 pints. Therefore, the amount of red paint used in the mural is 2 pints, and the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, understand the proportion of each color used in the mural based on the provided information. We know that half of the mural is painted yellow, and the other half is split equally among red, white, and purple. Given the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, we can assign half of this amount to the yellow paint because half the mural is yellow. The remaining half will then be divided equally among the three other colors. By calculating the specific amount allocated to each of these three colors, we can determine the amount of red paint used.\n\nAnswer:\nHalf of the total paint amount, which is 12 pints, used for the yellow color would be 12/2 = 6 pints. The remaining 6 pints are equally divided between the red, white, and purple paints. Thus, each of these colors would use 6 pints divided by 3 = 2 pints. Therefore, the amount of red paint used in the mural is 2 pints, so the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve the problem, we first need to quantify the distribution of the paint used on the mural. We know that the mural uses four colors: red, white, purple, and yellow. According to the problem, half of the mural is painted yellow. We also know that the red, white, and purple paints have similar quantities. The problem states that 12 pints of paint were used in total. \n1. Calculate the total amount of yellow paint used, which is half of the total paint, by multiplying the total paint (12 pints) by 0.5.\n2. Subtract the amount of yellow paint from the total paint to find the combined amount used by red, white, and purple.\n3. Divide this result by three to find the amount of each of the other three colors since the mural uses equal amounts of red, white, and purple.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Total paint used = 12 pints.\n2. Yellow paint used = 0.5 x 12 = 6 pints.\n3. Total paint for red, white, and purple = 12 - 6 = 6 pints.\n4. Amount of red paint = 6 \u00f7 3 = 2 pints.\n\nThus, the amount of red paint used in the mural is 2 pints, so the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find out how many pints of red paint were used, first determine the total amount of paint in the mural, which is given as 12 pints. Given that half of the mural is painted yellow, calculate how much paint is allocated to the yellow portion. After that, determine how the remaining paint is distributed among the red, white, and purple sections, knowing these three colors share equal amounts of the remaining paint.\n\nAnswer:\nThe mural used a total of 12 pints of paint. Since half of the mural is yellow, it uses half of the total paint amount:\n12 pints \u00d7 0.5 = 6 pints for the yellow paint.\n\nThe remaining paint for the other three colors (red, white, and purple) is:\n12 pints - 6 pints = 6 pints.\n\nThese 6 pints are equally divided among the red, white, and purple paints. Therefore, each color uses:\n6 pints / 3 = 2 pints.\n\nThus, 2 pints of red paint was used, so the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nWe know that half of the mural is yellow paint and the total amount of paint used is 12 pints. Therefore, 6 pints must be yellow paint since it accounts for half the total (50%). The rest of the paint (the other 6 pints) is equally divided among the red, white, and purple paints. Since there are three colors other than yellow, we divide the remaining 6 pints by 3 to find out how much of each of the other colors is used.\n\nAnswer:\nGiven that 6 pints of the 12 are used for yellow, the remaining 6 pints are divided equally among red, white, and purple. Dividing 6 pints by 3 colors, each color receives 2 pints. Thus, the amount of red paint used in the mural is 2 pints. Therefore, the answer is 2.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, we determine the total amount of paint used in the mural, which is given as 12 pints. We know that half of the mural is painted yellow, so we calculate the amount of yellow paint by taking half of the total. With the remaining volume of paint, we must divide it equally among the three other colors: red, white, and purple. By calculating the portion of paint used per color, we can find the amount of red paint used.\n\nAnswer:\nThe mural uses a total of 12 pints of paint. Since half the mural is yellow, it uses 12/2 = 6 pints of yellow paint. The remaining 6 pints are divided equally among the three other colors: red, white, and purple. Therefore, each of these colors uses 6 pints / 3 = 2 pints. Thus, 2 pints of red paint were used. The answer is 2."

Since one out of every two customers buys a car, double the number of cars to sell\u2014i.e., Jason needs 30 customers to visit (15 cars x 2).\n- Second, to get these 30 visits, we apply the first ratio. Since 25 calls result in one visit, multiply the number of visits by 25\u2014i.e., Jason needs to make 750 calls (30 customers x 25 calls per customer).\n\nAnswer:\nBased on this calculation, Jason needs to make 750 telephone calls to sell 15 cars and earn his bonus; therefore, the answer is 750.",

Since half the customers who visit make a purchase (1 purchase per 2 visits), Jason would need double the number of desired sales in visits.\n2. Calculate the number of phone calls required to bring the necessary number of customers to the dealership. Given that one customer visits for every 25 calls, we will use this ratio to find the total number of calls.\n\nWe will perform these calculations systematically in the response.\n\nAnswer:\nStep 1: Calculate visitors needed:\nSince 1 car is sold for every 2 visitors, Jason needs to double 15 (number of cars he wants to sell) to find the number of visitors needed:\n15 cars * 2 = 30 visitors.\n\nStep 2: Calculate phone calls needed to get 30 visitors:\nSince 1 visitor comes for every 25 calls, we multiply the number of visitors by 25 to get the total number of phone calls:\n30 visitors * 25 phone calls/visitor = 750 phone calls.\n\nTherefore, Jason needs to make 750 phone calls to expect 15 car purchases and earn his bonus; the answer is 750.",

We know that all three sisters are 16 years old each, one brother is 12 years old, and the other brother's age can be calculated as double the younger brother's age (since he is half his older brother's age).\n\nAnswer:\nThe ages of the siblings are as follows:\n- Three sisters, each aged 16 years: \\(3 \\times 16 = 48\\)\n- One brother aged 12 years.\n- The other brother (twice the age of the 12-year-old): \\(12 \\times 2 = 24\\)\n\nAdding these together gives:\n\\[48 (sisters) + 12 (younger brother) + 24 (older brother) = 84\\]\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years. Hence, the answer is 84.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, calculate the age of the older brother using the information given that the younger brother is 12 years old and his age is half that of the older brother. Next, sum the ages of all the siblings: the three sisters (all the same age) and the two brothers, based on the ages identified.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, determine the age of the older brother. Since the younger brother is 12 years old and this is half the age of the older brother, the older brother is 12 x 2 = 24 years old. Now calculate the total age of the siblings: \nAges of three sisters = 16 + 16 + 16 = 48 years,\nAge of the younger brother = 12 years,\nAge of the older brother = 24 years.\nAdding these together, 48 + 12 + 24 = 84 years. Therefore, the total age of the siblings is 84 years, and the answer is 84.",
            "Strategy:\nThe problem provides the ages of siblings in a family: three sisters who are each 16 years old and two brothers, one of whom is 12 years old and the other is twice his age. To find the total age, I will add together the ages of all the siblings.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, calculate the total age of the sisters:\n3 sisters \u00d7 16 years/sister = 48 years\n\nNext, determine the age of the older brother:\nThe older brother's age = 2 \u00d7 12 years (age of the younger brother) = 24 years\n\nNow, calculate the total age of the brothers:\n12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) = 36 years\n\nFinally, add the total ages of the sisters and brothers together:\n48 years (sisters) + 36 years (brothers) = 84 years\n\nTherefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years. The answer is 84.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this, start by determining the age of the older brother based on the information given about the younger brother. Next, add up the ages of all siblings. Three sisters have the same age (16 each), one brother is 12, and the older brother's age is twice that of the younger one (24).\n\nAnswer:\nFirst calculate the total age of all sisters: 3 sisters x 16 years each = 48 years.\nThe younger brother is 12 years old.\nThe older brother is twice the age of the younger brother: 12 years x 2 = 24 years.\nAdd the ages: 48 years (sisters) + 12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) = 84 years.\n\nThus, the total age of all siblings is 84 years, therefore the answer is 84."
