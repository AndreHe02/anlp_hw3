Subtracting each portion from the total as we resolve each step allows us to track how many vacuum cleaners are left after each sale. We then set up the final equation with the vacuum cleaners left after the last sale (orange house) equated to 5, as stated.

The number of cleaners sold at the green house is then x/3. After selling these, she has 2x/3 vacuum cleaners left. At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners; hence, the number she has left after this is 2x/3 - 2. Next, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. Therefore, she sold (2x/3 - 2)/2 = x/3 - 1 cleaners at the orange house. After this sale, she has 2x/3 - 2 - (x/3 - 1) vacuum cleaners left.

She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house; add these back to the total after the orange house.\n4. Finally, backtrack to the amount before selling a third of her vacuum cleaners to the green house. Since she sold a third, compute the total by determining what number, when divided by three, results in the amount after the sale to the green house.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Melanie had 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half her remaining stock at the orange house, meaning she had 5 * 2 = 10 vacuum cleaners before the sale at the orange house.\n2. Before the red house sale, Melanie sold 2 additional cleaners, so before this sale, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.\n3. Prior to the green house sale, where she sold a third, we need a number that, after selling a third, leaves her with 12.

            "Strategy:\nTo find out the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie originally had, we can backtrack through the problem using algebra. First, recognize the sequence of transactions and let x be the total number of vacuum cleaners. We keep a track of remaining cleaners at each step:\n1. Melanie sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, leaving her with 2/3 of the original number, x.\n2. She then sold 2 more at the red house, this decreases the number she had after the first transaction.\n3. Next, she sold half of whatever was left at the orange house.\n4. Finally, it\u2019s given that she has 5 left after selling at the orange house.\n\nWe can set up the equation based on these steps, solve for x, and then verify if the steps make sense accounting for the integer nature of the vacuum cleaners sold (as fractions of vacuum cleaners wouldn't make practical sense).\n\nAnswer:\nStart from the end where Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left after selling half at the orange house. Prior to the sale at the orange house, she would have had 5 (remaining) * 2 (she sold half) = 10 vacuum cleaners.\n\nThen, before selling 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house, she had 10 + 2 = 12 vacuum cleaners.\n\nSince at the green house she sold 1/3 of her vacuum cleaners, before that sale she had all of her vacuum cleaners. After selling a third, she had 2/3 left, thus 12 represents 2/3 of her total stock. Therefore, solving for the total stock x:\n2/3 * x = 12\nx = 12 / (2/3)\nx = 12 * (3/2)\nx = 18.\n\nSo, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners; therefore, the answer is 18.",

The problem states that she sold one-third of the vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she was left with two-thirds of the original amount, i.e., \\( \\frac{2}{3}x \\). Next, she sold 2 more vacuums at the red house, leaving her with \\( \\frac{2}{3}x - 2 \\) vacuums.

Add these distances together to determine the total distance Dana can travel in the 6 hours.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Dana's skipping speed is provided as 3 mph.\n2. Since Dana\u2019s running speed is twice her skipping speed, she can run at 2 * 3 = 6 mph.\n3. Dana runs four times faster than she can walk; therefore, her walking speed is her running speed divided by 4, which is 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.\n\nTo break down the 6 hours:\n- Dana spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. So, 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours running, and 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.\n\nDuring the 2 hours of running at 6 mph:\n- Distance = Speed * Time = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles.\n\nDuring the 4 hours of walking at 1.5 mph:\n- Distance = Speed * Time = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles.\n\nAdding these distances gives us:\n- Total distance = 12 miles (running) + 6 miles (walking) = 18 miles.\n\nHence, the answer is 18.",

Add the distances from running and walking to get the total distance traveled.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour. \n2. Since skipping is half as fast as running, her running speed would be 2 \u00d7 3 mph = 6 mph.\n3. Running speed is four times her walking speed. So, walking speed = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.\n4. Dana spends 6 total hours, with one-third spent running and two-thirds spent walking. That equates to 2 hours running and 4 hours walking.\n5. Distance traveled while running: 6 mph \u00d7 2 hours = 12 miles.\n6. Distance traveled while walking: 1.5 mph \u00d7 4 hours = 6 miles.\n7.

Sum the distances from each activity to get the total distance traveled.\n\nAnswer:\nStarting with the given information that Dana skips at 3 miles per hour:\n- Dana's running speed is twice the skipping speed (because her running speed is 4 times her walking speed, and her skipping speed is half of her running speed). So, her running speed is 2 * 3 mph = 6 mph.\n- Dana's walking speed is one-quarter of her running speed, which makes it 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph.\n\nDana spends one-third of the total time of 6 hours running and two-thirds walking.\n- Time running: 6 hours * (1/3) = 2 hours\n- Time walking: 6 hours * (2/3) = 4 hours\n\nCalculating distance covered:\n- Distance while running = Running speed * Time running = 6 mph * 2 hours = 12 miles\n- Distance while walking = Walking speed * Time walking = 1.5 mph * 4 hours = 6 miles\n\nAdding these distances gives the total distance traveled:\n- Total distance = Distance while running + Distance while walking = 12 miles + 6 miles = 18 miles\n\nTherefore, the answer is 18.",

Use these speeds to determine the distance she covers during each phase of her journey: running for one-third of the time and walking for two-thirds of the time. The final step is to add the distances covered during running and walking to find the total distance Dana travels in six hours.\n\nAnswer:\nGiven that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and this is half of her running speed, her running speed is:\nSkipping speed = 3 mph = 1/2 \u00d7 Running Speed\nRunning Speed = 2 \u00d7 3 mph = 6 mph\n\nDana\u2019s walking speed is one-quarter of her running speed, which can be calculated as:\nWalking speed = Running speed / 4 = 6 mph / 4 = 1.5 mph\n\nDana spends two hours running (one-third of six hours) and four hours walking (two-thirds of six hours).

Thus, buying the flowers using the packages of 2 results in a savings of $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00. Therefore, the answer is 6.",
            "Strategy:\nTo determine the better price option for purchasing 18 flowers, we'll first calculate the cost for each package option and then compare them to find out which option offers more savings.\n\n1. Calculate the cost per flower in each package:\n   - Packages of 3 flowers for $2.50:\n     Cost per flower = $2.50 / 3 = $0.833 per flower.\n   - Packages of 2 flowers for $1:\n     Cost per flower = $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.\n\n2. For 18 flowers:\n   - Using packages of 3 flowers:\n     Number of packages needed = 18 / 3 = 6 packages.\n     Total cost = 6 * $2.50 = $15.00.\n   - Using packages of 2 flowers:\n     Number of packages needed = 18 / 2 = 9 packages.\n     Total cost = 9 * $1 = $9.00.\n\n3. Calculate the savings:\n   Savings = Cost with packages of 3 - Cost with packages of 2\n           = $15 - $9\n           = $6.\n\n4.

Therefore, the answer is 6.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Calculate the cost per flower for each package option:\n   - For packages of 3, the cost is $2.50, broken down per flower as $2.50 / 3 = $0.833 per flower.\n   - For packages of 2, the cost is $1, broken down per flower as $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower.\n\n2. Identify the cheaper price per flower:\n   - The price per flower in packages of 2 ($0.50) is cheaper than in packages of 3 ($0.833).\n\n3. Calculate total cost for the cheaper package:\n   - Figure out how many packages of 2 are needed to buy 18 flowers: 18 flowers divide by 2 flowers per package = 9 packages.\n   - Calculate total cost for 9 packages at $1 each = 9 x $1 = $9.\n\n4. Calculate cost if buying using the more expensive option:\n   - Determine how many packages of 3 are needed to buy 18 flowers: 18 flowers divided by 3 flowers per package = 6 packages.\n   - Calculate total cost for 6 packages at $2.50 each = 6 x $2.50 = $15.\n\n5. Subtract the lower cost from the higher cost to find out how much is saved:\n   - $15 (cost for packages of 3) - $9 (cost for packages of 2) = $6.\n\nAnswer:\nVincent saves $6 by buying the packages of 2 instead of the packages of 3, so the answer is 6.",

After calculating how many Poppy's mom places, we subtract this number from the remaining pieces to find out how many are left unplaced.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, determine the number of pieces Poppy places:\n1/4 of 1000 = 250 pieces.\n\nThis leaves:\n1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining.\n\nNext, Poppy's mom places 1/3 of the remaining 750 pieces:\n1/3 of 750 = 250 pieces.\n\nThis leaves:\n750 - 250 = 500 pieces.\n\nThus, there are 500 pieces left to be placed on the board. Therefore, the answer is 500.",

Subtract this number from the original number of elves to find out how many elves remained. Then, subtract the 10 additional elves who quit after being kicked in the shins to find the final number of elves left.\n\nAnswer:\nNissa initially hires 60 elves. A third of them quit when children vomit on them, which amounts to 60 x 1/3 = 20 elves quitting. That leaves 60 - 20 = 40 elves.

            "Strategy:\nTo determine how many miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider his walking schedule. Pancho walks 20 miles per day during weekdays (Monday through Friday) and 10 miles per day during weekends (Saturday and Sunday). To calculate the total miles, we multiply the number of miles walked per day by the number of days he walks that distance, for both weekdays and weekends. Finally, we sum the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to get the total for the week.\n\nAnswer:\nPancho walks 20 miles per day from Monday to Friday, which sums up to 20 miles x 5 days = 100 miles. On weekends, he walks 10 miles per day for 2 days, adding up to 10 miles x 2 days = 20 miles. Therefore, the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week is 100 miles + 20 miles = 120 miles.

Mark's age two years ago = 14 + 5 = 19.\nStep 3: Mark's current age = 19 + 2 = 21.\nStep 4: Jean\u2019s current age = 21 + 2 = 23.\n\nTherefore, Jean is 23 years old, so the answer is 23.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find Jean's age:\n1. Define the relationship between Jean and Mark's ages.\n2. Use the information about Mark's age two years ago in relation to Jan's age to find Mark's current age.\n3. Use Mark's current age to find Jean's current age since Jean is two years older than Mark.\n\nAnswer:\nStep 1: Let Mark's current age be M and Jean's current age be J. From the problem statement, J = M + 2.\nStep 2: Two years ago, Mark's age was (M - 2). At that time, it was stated that Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Since Jan is currently 30, two years ago Jan was 28. Hence, half of Jan\u2019s age two years ago was 14. Therefore, M - 2 = 14 + 5 = 19.\nStep 3: Solving for M, we get M = 19 + 2 = 21.\nStep 4: Using J = M + 2, substitute the value of M: J = 21 + 2 = 23.\n\nThus, Jean's current age is 23 years, so the answer is 23.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Start by identifying and setting up the known ages: According to the problem statement, Jan is 30 years old.\n2. Convert the description of the age relationships into equations. The first statement is that Jean is two years older than Mark, i.e., \\( J = M + 2 \\).\n3. The next key piece of information is that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. First, calculate half of Jan's age (which is 30), resulting in 15. This fact given 2 years ago would be represented by the equation \\( M - 2 = 15 + 5 \\).\n4. Solve the equations step-by-step to find Mark's and subsequently Jean\u2019s current age.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, simplify the equation for Mark's age from two years ago:\n\\[ M - 2 = 15 + 5 = 20 \\]\nFrom this, solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[ M = 20 + 2 = 22 \\]\nNow, use this value to find Jean\u2019s current age:\n\\[ J = M + 2 = 22 + 2 = 24 \\]\nThus, Jean is currently 24 years old, so the answer is 24.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve the question, let's define:\n- \\( J \\) as Jean's current age.\n- \\( M \\) as Mark's current age.\n- \\( A \\) as Jan's current age, which is given as 30 years.\n\n1. Start by translating the information provided into equations:\n   - Jean is two years older than Mark: \\( J = M + 2 \\)\n   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age then: \\( M - 2 = \\frac{A - 2}{2} + 5 \\)\n\n2. Since \\( A = 30 \\), substitute \\( A \\) in the second equation and solve for \\( M \\):\n   - \\( M - 2 = \\frac{30 - 2}{2} + 5 \\)\n   - \\( M - 2 = 14 + 5 \\)\n   - \\( M - 2 = 19 \\)\n   - \\( M = 21 \\)\n\n3. Using the value of \\( M \\), use the first equation to find \\( J \\):\n   - \\( J = M + 2 = 21 + 2 = 23 \\)\n\nThe goal is to determine Jean's age, so use the information found to conclude Jean\u2019s age.\n\nAnswer:\nJean's current age is 23. Thus, the answer is 23.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, establish the relationship between Jean and Mark's ages based on the information given. According to the problem, Jean is two years older than Mark. Therefore, if Mark's age is represented as M, then Jean's age is M + 2 years.\n\nNext, address the second piece of information provided: Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. Given that Jan is 30 years old now, Jan's age two years ago was 28. Half of Jan's age two years ago was 14 years. Therefore, two years ago Mark was 5 years older than 14 years, which calculates to 19 years. This represents Mark's age two years ago.\n\nThus, Mark's current age M would be 19 + 2 = 21 years since two years have passed from the time described.\n\nFinally, substitute Mark's age back into the relationship defined between Jean and Mark's ages. If Mark is 21 years old, then Jean, being two years older, is 21 + 2 = 23 years old.\n\nAnswer:\nJean is 23 years old. The answer is 23."

Since Steve eats 6 per day and his consumption is twice that of his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day. Together, they eat 9 tomatoes per day. Calculating for a week, they require 9 tomatoes per day \u00d7 7 days = 63 tomatoes per week. Given that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, divide the total number of tomatoes required per week by the number produced per vine to determine the number of vines required.\n\nAnswer:\nSteve and his girlfriend together need 63 tomatoes per week. Each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week, so they need a total of 63 tomatoes \u00f7 3 tomatoes per vine = 21 vines. The answer is 21.",
            "Strategy:\n1. Determine Steve's daily and weekly tomato consumption.\n2. Determine Steve's girlfriend's tomato consumption based on Steve eating twice as many.\n3. Calculate total weekly consumption of tomatoes for both Steve and his girlfriend.\n4. Understand the weekly production of one vine of cherry tomatoes.\n5. Calculate how many vines are required to meet the weekly consumption of tomatoes by dividing the total weekly consumption by the production per vine.\n\nAnswer: \nFirst, we calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats per week. Since he eats 6 tomatoes per day, multiplying this by 7 days gives us 6 * 7 = 42 tomatoes per week. Since Steve eats twice as many tomatoes as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, which results in 3 * 7 = 21 tomatoes per week. Combined, they eat 42 tomatoes (Steve) + 21 tomatoes (his girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes per week. \n\nOne vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. Therefore, to find out how many vines they need to produce 63 tomatoes weekly, we divide the total weekly requirement by the production per vine, that is 63 / 3 = 21. \n\nTherefore, they need 21 vines to meet their weekly consumption of tomatoes, so the answer is 21."

Since there are 12 cookies in a dozen, divide the amount of flour (2 cups) by the number of cookies (12) to find the flour required per cookie. Then, multiply this amount by the total number of cookies Carla plans to make today (36) and tomorrow (30) to find the total amount of flour she will need.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Calculate the flour needed per cookie:\n   Flour per dozen cookies = 2 cups\n   Cookies per dozen = 12\n   Flour per cookie = 2 cups / 12 cookies = 1/6 cup\n\n2. Calculate the total flour needed for 36 cookies today:\n   Flour needed = 36 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 6 cups\n\n3. Calculate the total flour needed for 30 cookies tomorrow:\n   Flour needed = 30 cookies * 1/6 cup per cookie = 5 cups\n\n4.

Finally, divide this number by two to determine the number of stitches per sleeve.\n\nAnswer:\nFirst, calculate the stitches for the collar and the rosette:\n- The stitches for the collar = \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 900 = 90 \\) stitches.\n- The stitches for the rosette = \\( 2 \\times 90 = 180 \\) stitches.\n\nNow, add up the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette:\n- Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette = \\( 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \\) stitches.\n\nDeduct this from the total project stitches to find the combined stitches for both sleeves:\n- Combined stitches for both sleeves = \\( 1800 - 1170 = 630 \\) stitches.\n\nSince the sweater has two sleeves, the stitches per sleeve will be:\n- Stitches per sleeve = \\( \\frac{630}{2} = 315 \\) stitches.\n\nThus, each sleeve takes 315 stitches, and the answer is 315.",
            "Strategy:\nFirst, calculate the stitches required for both the collar and the rosette based on the figures provided. Using these results and the given total number of stitches for the body, sum the stitches used for these parts. Then, deduce the total stitches used for both sleeves by subtracting the computed total from the overall stitch count for the whole sweater. Assume that each sleeve takes the same number of stitches, and divide the number of sleeve stitches by two to find the count per sleeve.\n\nAnswer:\nThe body of the sweater uses 900 stitches. According to the problem, the collar uses a tenth of the number of stitches used in the body, which calculates to:\n\\[ 900/10 = 90 \\text{ stitches for the collar}. \\]\n\nThe rosette uses twice the number of stitches as the collar, so:\n\\[ 2 \\times 90 = 180 \\text{ stitches for the rosette}. \\]\n\nAdding the stitches for the body, collar, and rosette gives:\n\\[ 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 \\text{ stitches used in total for these parts}. \\]\n\nThe project in total is an 1800-stitch sweater, so subtract the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total:\n\\[ 1800 - 1170 = 630 \\text{ stitches remaining for both sleeves combined}. \\]\n\nDivide the stitches remaining by 2 to find the count per sleeve:\n\\[ 630/2 = 315 \\text{ stitches for each sleeve}. \\]\n\nTherefore, each sleeve takes 315 stitches, so the answer is 315.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve this problem, first calculate the number of stitches used for the parts of the sweater where the stitches have been provided or can be inferred:\n1. Stitches used for the body = 900 stitches.\n2. Stitches used for the collar = a tenth of the body stitches. Calculate this value.\n3. Stitches used for the rosette = twice the number of collar stitches. Calculate this value.\n4. Add the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette to find the total stitches used for these parts.\n5. Subtract this total from the overall total stitches for the sweater to find the number of stitches used for the two sleeves combined.\n6. Finally, to find the number of stitches per sleeve, divide the total stitches for sleeves by two.\n\nAnswer:\n1. Stitches for the body = 900\n2. Stitches for the collar = 900 / 10 = 90\n3. Stitches for the rosette = 90 * 2 = 180\n4. Total stitches for body, collar, and rosette = 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170\n5. Total stitches for the two sleeves = 1800 (total stitches for the sweater) - 1170 = 630\n6. Stitches per sleeve = 630 / 2 = 315\n\nHence, each sleeve takes 315 stitches, so the answer is 315.",
            "Strategy:\nTo solve the problem, first, I would calculate the number of stitches required for the collar as it is given as a tenth of the body (900 stitches). Then, find the stitches for the rosette since it's twice as many as the collar. The total number of stitches for these parts of the sweater will be subtracted from 1800 to find the stitches left for the sleeves. Since there are two sleeves, the remaining stitches will be divided by two to find the number of stitches per sleeve.\n\nAnswer:\nStarting with the body of the sweater, it takes 900 stitches. The collar, taking a tenth of the body, requires 900 / 10 = 90 stitches. The rosette, taking twice as many stitches as the collar, requires 2 * 90 = 180 stitches. Adding these together, the body, collar, and rosette collectively use 900 + 90 + 180 = 1170 stitches.\n\nThe total stitches in the sweater are 1800; hence the remaining stitches are 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches. Since these stitch counts must account for both sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 315.",
            "Strategy:\nTo find the number of stitches each sleeve takes, first calculate the number of stitches required to knit the collar and the decorative rosette based on the provided ratios. Then, subtract the stitches used for the body, collar, and rosette from the total stitches to find the total stitches used for both sleeves combined. Lastly, divide this number by two to get the number of stitches per sleeve.\n\nAnswer:\nCalculate the stitches for the collar: 900 (body stitches) \u00f7 10 = 90 stitches for the collar.\nCalculate the stitches for the rosette: 90 (collar stitches) x 2 = 180 stitches for the rosette.\nCalculate the total stitches for the body, collar, and rosette: 900 (body) + 90 (collar) + 180 (rosette) = 1170 stitches.\nTotal stitches for the entire sweater are 1800.\nTotal stitches used for both sleeves: 1800 (total stitches) - 1170 (body, collar, rosette) = 630 stitches.\nEach sleeve takes half of 630, so 630 \u00f7 2 = 315 stitches per sleeve.\nThus, the answer is 315.",

            "Strategy:\nTo solve the problem, my strategy involves computing the stitches for each component: body, collar, and rosette. Next, I will deduct the sum of these components from the total to find the stitches used for the sleeves. Finally, since the sweater has two sleeves and they are presumed equal, I will divide the result by two to find the number of stitches per sleeve.\n\n1. **Calculate the number of stitches for the collar**: The collar takes a tenth of the stitches it takes to make the body. Since the body takes 900 stitches, the collar will take \\( \\frac{1}{10} \\times 900 = 90 \\) stitches.\n2. **Calculate the number of stitches for the rosette**: The rosette takes twice the stitches of the collar.
